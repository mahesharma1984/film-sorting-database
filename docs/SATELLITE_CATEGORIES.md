# SATELLITE TIER - CATEGORY DEFINITIONS & CAPS

## Purpose
- Genre extremities, exploitation, cult oddities

---

### 6. AMERICAN NEW HOLLYWOOD (NEW - Issue #27)

**Definition:**
- Post-Production Code prestige studio cinema, c.1965–1985
- The bounded industrial moment when a generation of directors reshaped American studio filmmaking between the collapse of the Code and the blockbuster era
- Distinct from American Exploitation (grindhouse/cult) and from Core (auteur identity)

**Date bounds:** 1960s–1980s (captures 1965–1985 span across three system decades)

**Directors (routing gate — widest configuration):**
- **Category Core:** Bob Fosse, Hal Ashby, Alan J. Pakula
- **Category Reference:** Sydney Pollack, Sidney Lumet, Peter Bogdanovich, Robert Altman
- **Overlapping Core candidates:** Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese
  - NOTE: Coppola and Scorsese are also strong Core whitelist candidates. If they are added to the Core director whitelist, the Core check (Stage 3) fires first and they never reach Satellite routing. The overlap is safe — Core priority prevents double-classification.

**Cap:** 25 films

**Cap per decade:**
- 1960s: max 5 films (only late-60s: 1965–1969)
- 1970s: max 15 films (peak of the movement)
- 1980s: max 5 films (movement fading into blockbuster era)

**Rationale:**
- Without this category, Fosse and Russ Meyer end up in the same folder (American Exploitation), collapsing the distinction between a prestige auteur and a grindhouse specialist
- Density: 15–25 films in the collection currently misfiled in AmEx, Indie Cinema, or Unsorted
- Coherence: documented historical movement with identifiable directors and a bounded industrial moment
- Archival necessity: the collection needs this distinction to be meaningful

**Boundary rules:**
- Fosse, Ashby, Pakula → Satellite/American New Hollywood (Category Core)
- Pollack, Lumet, Bogdanovich, Altman → Satellite/American New Hollywood (Category Reference)
- Coppola, Scorsese → Core if on whitelist; otherwise Satellite/American New Hollywood
- Russ Meyer → American Exploitation (genre specialist, not prestige cinema)
- John Waters → American Exploitation or Core (depending on collection expansion)
- Generic 1970s US dramas without a listed director → Unsorted (no country-gate; director-only routing like FNW)

**Routing design:** Director-only routing (like French New Wave). US ('US') is NOT added to `COUNTRY_TO_WAVE` — that would auto-route all American films in those decades. Only films by listed directors qualify.

**Routing position:** Before American Exploitation in `SATELLITE_ROUTING_RULES`. Both are US historical categories, but American New Hollywood is more specific — it must be checked first to prevent its films from being caught by AmEx's broader net.

**Films currently in collection that belong here (examples):**
- All That Jazz (1979) — currently misclassified as Indie Cinema
- Being There (1979) — currently misclassified as Indie Cinema
- (Full audit of ~15–25 misfiled films to be completed as part of Issue #23 Stage 3)

- Alain Resnais (Last Year at Marienbad) - if not Core
- Jacques Rivette (if not Core)
- Louis Malle (Elevator to the Gallows)

**Cap:** 30 films

- Analogous to Giallo providing context for Italian modernism
- Prevents misrouting to European Sexploitation

---

### 16. INDIE CINEMA (NEW - Issue #14, WIDENED - Issue #20)

**Definition:**
- Functional arthouse catch-all for non-exploitation, non-Popcorn, non-Core films
- NOT a historical wave category — defined negatively by what it is NOT
- Covers international art/character-driven films from 30+ countries, 1960s–2020s
- Issue #20: expanded from post-1980 to 1960s–2020s; added CN, TW, KR, IR, JP, HU, IN, RO

**Directors (examples):**
- US: Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley, Kelly Reichardt, Todd Haynes
- International: Michael Haneke, Lars von Trier, Ken Loach

**Cap:** 40 films (review after Issue #20 expansion — scope has broadened)

**Rationale:**
- Fills gap between Core (auteur obsession) and Popcorn (mainstream entertainment)
- Unlike Giallo or Brazilian Exploitation (historical events with specific start/end dates),
  Indie Cinema is a functional routing label. It is analogous to Music Films (no decade
  restriction) — organized by what it serves, not what historical moment it names.
- JP in 1970s–1980s still routes to Pinku Eiga/Japanese Exploitation first; JP here only
  catches post-1980s Japanese films that fall through those categories.

**Boundary rules:**
- Coen Brothers, Lynch, P.T. Anderson → Core (on whitelist)
- Unknown indie dramas from covered film countries → Indie Cinema
- Mainstream studio films → Popcorn
- Exploitation directors' post-category films → Indie Cinema (decade bounds respected)

---

### 17. CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD (NEW - Issue #14)

**Definition:**
- American studio cinema from classical era
- Pre-1960 (before New Hollywood rupture)
- Genre cinema: Film Noir, Westerns, Musicals, Melodrama

**Cap:** 25 films

**Rationale:**
- Reference canon only covers ~10 classic Hollywood films (Casablanca, Sunset Blvd)
- Genre classics that aren't Reference-tier but provide historical context
- Films like The Searchers, Sweet Smell of Success, Touch of Evil (if not by Core directors)

**Boundary rules:**
- Orson Welles, Billy Wilder → Core (if on whitelist)
- Canonical classics → Reference (Casablanca, Citizen Kane)
- Genre classics → Satellite (The Big Sleep, Out of the Past)

---

**TOTAL SATELLITE CAP: ~530 films maximum across 17 categories** (increased by 25 with American New Hollywood)

This is intentionally large because Satellite is the margins/texture tier. But individual category caps keep it from sprawling.

---

## SATELLITE ORGANIZATION (Issue #6 Update)

**New Structure: Category-First (Satellite/{category}/{decade}/)**

Based on Issue #6 implementation, Satellite is now organized by category first, then decade:

```
Satellite/
├── Giallo/
│   ├── 1960s/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   └── 1980s/
├── Pinku Eiga/
│   ├── 1960s/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   └── 1980s/
├── Japanese Exploitation/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   └── 1980s/
├── Brazilian Exploitation/
│   ├── 1960s/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   ├── 1980s/
│   └── 1990s/
├── Hong Kong Action/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   ├── 1980s/
│   └── 1990s/
├── American Exploitation/
│   ├── 1960s/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   ├── 1980s/
│   ├── 1990s/
│   └── 2000s/
├── European Sexploitation/
│   ├── 1960s/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   └── 1980s/
├── Blaxploitation/
│   ├── 1970s/
│   └── 1990s/
└── Music Films/
    └── (decade-agnostic)
```

**Rationale:**
- Browse all Giallo together, all Pinku Eiga together, etc.
- Decades are subdivisions WITHIN each thematic category
- More intuitive navigation than decade-first structure

---

## BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT RULES

### What Qualifies for Satellite?

**YES:**
- Genre extremities (giallo, pinku, exploitation)
- Cult films without auteur claim
- VHS/grindhouse texture
- Category filmmaking (HK action, blaxploitation)
- Films kept for margins/context, not spine

**NO (goes to Core instead):**
- Any film by a Core whitelist director
- Auteur-driven cult (Jodorowsky, Lynch, Waters)
- Films that define your collection identity

**NO (goes to Popcorn instead):**
- Rewatchable American entertainment
- Studio films you return to for pleasure
- Format-curated mainstream (35mm open matte Spider-Man)

**NO (gets cut to /Out):**
- Pure obligation, no pleasure
- Redundant within category (e.g., 10th generic giallo)
- Low-quality exploitation you don't care about

---

## PER-DECADE SATELLITE DENSITY

Based on collection analysis:

**1960s Satellite: ~30 films**
- Early exploitation, giallo origins, pinku eiga

**1970s Satellite: ~150 films** (largest wave)
- Brazilian pornochanchada boom
- Giallo peak
- American grindhouse
- Blaxploitation
- Pinku eiga peak

**1980s Satellite: ~120 films**
- VHS cult boom
- HK action explosion
- Late giallo/Italian horror
- American DTV exploitation

**1990s Satellite: ~80 films**
- HK action peak (pre-handover)
- Late exploitation
- DTV cult

**2000s-2010s Satellite: ~30 films**
- Selective cult oddities
- Digital-era exploitation

**TOTAL SATELLITE ESTIMATE: ~410 films** (within caps)

---

## CRITICAL NOTES

### Satellite ≠ Dump Tier
- Every film in Satellite should be there intentionally
- "I want this texture in my archive" not "I guess I'll keep it"
- When in doubt, cut to /Out

### Satellite Expands Core
- Satellite shows what orbits around your auteur spine
- It's the margins that make Core feel centered
- But it can't overwhelm Core

### Monthly Review
- Check if any Satellite category is over cap
- Cut weakest films in that category
- Resist "but it's rare!" unless you actually care

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Verify current Satellite film count per category
2. Adjust caps if needed
3. Move to Phase 1, Task 4: Popcorn Rules

**Does this Satellite structure work? Any categories to add/remove/adjust?**
