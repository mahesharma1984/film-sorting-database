# Archived Documentation

These documents are historical artifacts from the project's pre-automation phases (Phase 1 manual planning, Phase 2 manual sorting, and early design proposals). They are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained or operationally relevant.

For current documentation, see `docs/CORE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
