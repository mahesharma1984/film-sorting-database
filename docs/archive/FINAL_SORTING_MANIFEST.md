- Require user decision

**3. Unknown/Unwatched**
- Films without enough metadata
- Films user hasn't seen yet

**4. Potential Cuts**
- Low-quality files

---

## STAGING WORKFLOW

### Monthly Review Process:

**Step 1: Borderline Decisions**
- Review all borderline films
- Make Core/Satellite/Popcorn/Reference calls
- Promote from Staging

**Step 2: Unwatched Films**
- Watch films in Staging/Unwatched
- Classify after viewing
- Promote or cut

**Step 3: Unknown Metadata**
- Research directors
- Identify decades
- Classify and promote

**Step 4: Cap Enforcement**
- Check all Satellite categories against caps
- Cut weakest films in over-cap categories (Brazilian needs -3)
- Move cuts to /Out

**Step 5: Quality Check**
- Remove low-quality files
- Remove redundancies
- Cut films kept "just in case"

---

## FILES TO CUT TO /OUT (Identified)

### Brazilian Exploitation Over Cap
Need to cut 3 weakest films from Brazilian category:
- Identify lowest quality or least interesting
- Move to /Out
- Review in 30 days before permanent deletion

### Potential Cuts (To Evaluate)
- Duplicate versions of same film
- Low-quality rips (480p, poor encoding)
- Films never watched in 2+ years
- "Completionist" acquisitions (full filmographies of minor directors)

---

## FINAL COLLECTION ESTIMATE (POST-SORTING)

**After Staging triage and /Out cuts:**

Estimated final curated collection: **~500-600 films**

**Tier breakdown (projected):**
- **Core:** ~140 films (add Warhol, Gondry, Kon, etc.)
- **Satellite:** ~240 films (trim Brazilian to cap)
- **Popcorn:** ~100 films (small growth)
- **Reference:** ~50 films (fill gaps with acquisitions)

**Total:** ~530 films (down from ~850 raw collection)

**Cut to /Out:** ~250-320 films

This creates a **lean, curated archive** aligned with your thesis.

---

- Andy Warhol (1960s-1970s)
- Michel Gondry (2000s)
