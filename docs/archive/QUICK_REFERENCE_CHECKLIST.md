- Pinku: 35 max

**Reference Cap:**
- 50 films total (currently ~35, room for ~15 more)

**No cap:** Core, Popcorn (but keep curated)

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Don't put Core auteur films in Popcorn**
Even if entertaining → if director on Core list, goes to Core

❌ **Don't keep films "just in case"**
If you won't watch it, cut it

❌ **Don't let Staging grow indefinitely**
Monthly review required

❌ **Don't exceed Satellite caps**
Cut weakest when over cap

❌ **Don't skip director verification**
When uncertain, look it up

---

## WHEN TO RESEARCH vs. WHEN TO STAGE

**Research immediately if:**
- Film seems like Core director work
- Film might be canonical Reference
- Takes < 2 minutes to verify

**Move to Staging if:**
- Research takes > 2 minutes
- Need to watch film first
- Multiple tier possibilities
- Uncertain about quality/keeping

**Don't slow down sorting to research everything.**

---

## MONTHLY REVIEW CHECKLIST

□ Review all /Staging/Borderline films
□ Watch films in /Staging/Unwatched
□ Research /Staging/Unknown films
□ Cut /Staging/Evaluate films to /Out
□ Check Satellite caps

## FINAL REMINDERS

✓ **Staging = Temporary holding** (monthly review required)
✓ **Out = 30-day quarantine** (then delete)

✓ **When in doubt → Staging**
✓ **Stay ruthless with cuts**
✓ **Monthly review is mandatory**
