# PHASE 1 COMPLETE - TIER SYSTEM LOCKED

## Summary

All classification rules defined. The library now has mechanical sorting criteria.

---

## TIER BREAKDOWN

### CORE: ~125-135 films (38-43 directors)
- **Purpose:** Auteur spine, collection identity
- **Rule:** Any film by Core whitelist director → Core
- **Density:** Heaviest in 1960s-1970s (modernist + political cinema)
- **Organization:** By director within decade folders

### REFERENCE: 50 films (hard cap)
- **Purpose:** Classical Hollywood + canonical touchstones
- **Rule:** Historically important, not auteur-driven Core
- **Currently owned:** ~30-35 films
- **Acquisitions needed:** ~18 films (wishlist created)
- **Organization:** Flat by title within decade folders

### SATELLITE: ~410 films (12 categories, individual caps)
- **Purpose:** Genre margins, exploitation, cult texture
- **Rule:** Kept intentionally for margins, not spine
- **Categories:**
  1. Giallo (30 cap)
  2. Pinku eiga (35 cap)
  3. Brazilian exploitation (45 cap)
  4. Hong Kong action/Category III (65 cap)

  9. WIP/rape-revenge (15 cap)
  10. Music films (20 cap)
  11. Mondo (10 cap)
  12. Cult oddities (50 cap)
- **Density:** Heaviest in 1970s (~150 films) and 1980s (~120 films)
- **Organization:** By subgenre + key directors (hybrid)

### POPCORN: ~255 films (10 categories)
- **Purpose:** Rewatchable American entertainment, pleasure archive
- **Rule:** "Would I put this on tonight?" test + format curation signals
- **Categories:**
  1. Superhero (25 cap)
  2. Sci-fi/fantasy (30 cap)
  3. Action/thriller (30 cap)
  4. Comedy (50 cap)

  7. Family/animation (20 cap)
  8. Music (15 cap)
  9. Bond/franchise (15 cap)
  10. Wild cards (20 cap)
- **Density:** Heaviest in 1980s-1990s (~160 films total)
- **Organization:** Franchise folders + flat

## TOTAL COLLECTION ESTIMATE

**Core:** ~135 films
**Reference:** 50 films
**Satellite:** ~410 films
**Popcorn:** ~255 films

**GRAND TOTAL: ~850 films** (curated from larger collection)

**Staging:** Unknown count (films needing classification)
**Out:** Unknown count (films to be cut)

---

## TIER HIERARCHY BY SIZE

1. **Satellite** (~410 films, 48%) - Largest tier, margins/texture
2. **Popcorn** (~255 films, 30%) - Second largest, pleasure archive
3. **Core** (~135 films, 16%) - Third, auteur spine
4. **Reference** (50 films, 6%) - Smallest, canonical touchstones

This distribution makes sense:
- Core is tight and auteur-focused (16%)
- Reference is deliberately capped (6%)
- Satellite is the largest because it's the margins (48%)
- Popcorn is substantial for rewatchable comfort (30%)
