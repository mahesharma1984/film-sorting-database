## CRITICAL REMINDERS

### The System Only Works If You Maintain It

**Monthly review is mandatory.**
Without it, Staging grows and the library drifts.

**Caps are non-negotiable.**
They prevent completionist bloat.

**Staging is temporary.**
Nothing stays there longer than 3 months.

**Out is a quarantine.**
30 days before deletion gives you safety net.

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

### Do This Now:

1. **Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** (full read, 30 minutes)
2. **Print QUICK_REFERENCE_CHECKLIST.md** (keep at desk)
3. **Open SORTING_DATABASE.md** (reference while sorting)
4. **Create folder structure** (2-3 hours)
5. **Start sorting Core films** (begin with Godard, Kubrick, Scorsese)

### Work Through Phases Sequentially:

Don't skip ahead. Core → Reference → Satellite → Popcorn → Staging.

Each phase builds on the last.

### Set Up Monthly Review:

Calendar reminder: "Movie Library Staging Review"

Last Sunday of every month.

2-3 hours.

Non-negotiable.
