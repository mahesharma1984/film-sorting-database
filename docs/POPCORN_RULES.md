# POPCORN TIER - RULES & DEFINITIONS

## Purpose
- American studio entertainment actually rewatched
- Not "Reference," not "Core," not "Satellite"
- Separate contract: **pleasure, not importance**
- Comfort viewing, repeat viewing, "put this on tonight" films

---

## THE POPCORN TEST

### Core Question:
**"Would I actually put this on tonight for pleasure, not obligation?"**

If YES → Popcorn
If "it's important but I won't rewatch" → Reference or cut
If "it's auteur-driven" → Core
If "it's cult/exploitation" → Satellite

### Secondary Signals:

**Format Curation = Popcorn Signal**
- 35mm open matte scans
- Special editions with commentary
- Upgraded formats (4K, UHD remux)
- These signal: "I care about the viewing experience, not just having it"

**Examples from Collection:**
- Spider-Man (2002) 35mm Full Frame ✓
- Spider-Man 2.1 Extended Open Matte ✓
- Spider-Man 3 Open Matte ✓
- Back to the Future Trilogy 35mm Open Matte ✓
- Batman (1989) 2K 35mm SuperWide Open Matte ✓
- Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) 35mm ✓
- Se7en (1995) 35mm scan ✓
- The Shining 35mm Open Matte → actually Core (Kubrick)
- You Only Live Twice IB Tech 35mm → Popcorn

**If you went out of your way to get the 35mm scan, it's probably Popcorn.**

### 3. Pleasure > Importance

- Kept because you actually enjoy watching it

### 4. Excludes Overlap with Other Tiers

## POPCORN BOUNDARY RULES

### Popcorn vs. Reference
**Reference wins if:**
- Film is canonical/historically important (Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Blade Runner)
- Film defined an era (Star Wars, Jaws, The Matrix)
- Film is "obligation viewing" even if you like it

**Popcorn wins if:**
- You rewatch it for pleasure, not importance
- It's not canonical but you love it
- Format curation signals personal investment (35mm scan)

**Borderline Examples:**
- **Se7en** → Could be either. Format (35mm) suggests Popcorn. But Fincher + cultural impact suggests Reference. **Your call.**
- **The Matrix** → Reference (too canonical, defines 1990s)
- **Pulp Fiction** → Reference (1990s indie canon)
- **Die Hard** → Reference (action cinema redefinition)
- **Back to the Future** → Popcorn (rewatchable comfort, not just canonical)

### Popcorn vs. Core
**Core wins if:**
- Director is on Core whitelist (Coen Brothers, Lynch, Scorsese, etc.)
- Film is auteur-driven even if entertaining

**Popcorn wins if:**
- Director is a studio workman (Robert Zemeckis, Sam Raimi non-auteur work)
- Film is genre entertainment without formal ambition

**Examples:**
- **Spider-Man** (Sam Raimi 2002) → Popcorn (genre work, not auteur project)
- **The Big Lebowski** (Coen Brothers) → Core (Core directors)
- **Magnolia** (P.T. Anderson) → Core (Core auteur)

### Popcorn vs. Satellite
**Satellite wins if:**
- Film is exploitation/cult/grindhouse
- Film is genre margins (giallo, pinku, grindhouse)
- Film is "kept for texture" not "kept for pleasure"

**Popcorn wins if:**
- Film is studio entertainment
- Film is rewatchable comfort viewing
- Film is mainstream (even if genre)

**Examples:**
- **Re-Animator** → Borderline. Exploitation roots (Satellite) but rewatchable cult classic (Popcorn). **Your call.**
- **Rush Hour** → Popcorn (studio action-comedy)
- **Frankenhooker** → Satellite (pure exploitation)
- **House Party** → Popcorn (studio comedy)

## POPCORN ORGANIZATION WITHIN DECADES

**Option A: By genre**
```
/1980s/Popcorn/Superhero/
/1980s/Popcorn/Comedy/

```

**Option B: Flat (browsable by title)**
```
/1980s/Popcorn/

## FORMAT CURATION SIGNALS

### High Curation = Popcorn
- **35mm scans** (Spider-Man, Batman, Back to the Future, Se7en)
- **Open matte versions** (full frame theatrical presentations)
- **Extended cuts** (Spider-Man 2.1, Spider-Man 3.1)
- **4K/UHD remux** (premium formats)
- **With commentary tracks** (signals personal investment)

### Standard Digital = Evaluate Carefully
- **1080p WEB-DL** → Could be Popcorn or just "downloaded and forgot"
- **720p YIFY** → Probably not Popcorn unless you rewatch often

**The rule:** If you went out of your way to get a better version, it's Popcorn.

## CRITICAL POPCORN RULES

### 1. The "Tonight Test"
- Would I put this on tonight for fun? YES → Popcorn
- Would I watch it again? MAYBE → Evaluate
- Will I never rewatch? NO → Reference, Satellite, or cut

### 2. Format = Investment Signal
- 35mm scan → You care → Popcorn
- Standard WEB-DL → Might be "downloaded and forgot"

### 3. No Guilt, No Obligation
- Popcorn is pure pleasure
- Not "I should watch this" (Reference)
- Not "This is important" (Core)
- Not "This is rare/weird" (Satellite)

### 4. American Studio Default
- Foreign language films → Usually Core or Satellite
- Exceptions: Comfort rewatches (like Amélie if you have it)

### 5. Auteur Check
- Always check Core director whitelist first
- If director is Core → film goes to Core even if entertaining
