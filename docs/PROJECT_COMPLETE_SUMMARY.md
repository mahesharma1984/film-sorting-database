## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. Collection Identity Confirmed
**1960s-1970s = 48% of Core films**
- Your collection IS the modernist + political cinema thesis
- Godard (15+ films), Ray (8 films), Yang (6 films), Hartley (6 films)
- The spine is exactly where you want it

### 2. Satellite is the Margins (Correctly)
**Brazilian exploitation** is your largest Satellite category (48 films)
- This is texture, not identity
- 1970s Satellite = exploitation boom (historically accurate)
- Margins make Core feel centered

### 3. Popcorn Needs Development
**Only ~91 films vs. ~255 cap**
- Collection is auteur/arthouse-heavy (correct for thesis)
- Popcorn has room to grow with studio canon
- Future Phase 6: Popcorn wave reorganization

### 4. Format Curation = Curatorial Signal
**35mm scans, open matte, extended cuts:**
- Spider-Man trilogy, Back to the Future, Batman
- This signals personal investment, not just "downloaded"
- Format curation separates Popcorn from obligation

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Core Auteur Additions Needed
Add to Core whitelist:
- **Andy Warhol** (Flesh, Trash, Heat - avant-garde essential)
- **John Waters** (Serial Mom, Pecker - already in collection)
- **Michel Gondry** (Be Kind Rewind)
- **Satoshi Kon** (Tokyo Godfathers)
- **P.T. Anderson** (Magnolia)

### Films to Reclassify
**Move FROM Satellite/Popcorn TO Core:**
- Warhol films (Flesh, Trash, Heat)
- Waters films (Serial Mom, Pecker)
- Gondry (Be Kind Rewind)
- Satoshi Kon (Tokyo Godfathers)

### Brazilian Satellite Trim
**Over cap by 3 films** - cut weakest to reach 45

### Borderline Films Decided
- **Re-Animator:** Popcorn (rewatchability wins)
- **Se7en 35mm:** Popcorn (format signal wins)
- **Back to the Future:** Popcorn (format + rewatchability)
- **Silence of the Lambs:** Reference (too canonical)
- **Buffalo '66:** User decision (Gallo auteur?)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Phase 3: Staging Triage (Manual Work Required)
1. **Review borderline films** - make Core/Satellite/Popcorn/Reference calls
2. **Watch unwatched films** - classify after viewing
3. **Research unknown metadata** - identify directors, decades
4. **Enforce caps** - cut Brazilian Satellite to 45
5. **Quality check** - remove low-quality files, redundancies
6. **Cut to /Out** - move ~250-320 films for deletion

### Phase 4: Decade-Wave Coherence Check
1. **Review each decade** - verify historical coherence
2. **Adjust for wave identity** - ensure each decade represents its cinema wave
3. **Check tier ratios** - Core smallest, Satellite/Popcorn balanced
4. **Final polish** - reorganize anything that feels misplaced

### Phase 5: Documentation & Maintenance
1. **Create README per decade** - what defines this wave, Core directors, Satellite boundaries
2. **Monthly review system** - Staging triage, new downloads
3. **Acquisition priorities** - Reference gaps, Core director expansions
4. **Annual boundary review** - adjust caps, remove/add Core directors

### Phase 6: Popcorn Thesis Development (Future)
1. **Research studio cinema waves** - map Western commercial cinema evolution
2. **Reorganize Popcorn by waves** - not flat genres, but historical periods
3. **Create Popcorn director whitelist** - genre craftsmen (Zemeckis, McTiernan, etc.)
4. **Build comprehensive studio canon** - parallel to Core auteur archive

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Collection Alignment
✓ **1960s-1970s = 48% of Core** (modernist + political spine)
✓ **Satellite heaviest in 1970s** (exploitation boom, historically accurate)
✓ **Popcorn heaviest in 1980s-1990s** (blockbuster/VHS era)
✓ **2000s-2010s selective** (late auteurs + digital cinema)

### Tier Balance
✓ **Core tight** (~140 films, 26% of final collection)
✓ **Reference capped** (50 films, deliberate limits)
✓ **Satellite largest** (~240 films, margins/texture)
✓ **Popcorn substantial** (~100 films, pleasure archive)

### Curatorial Intent
✓ **Every tier has clear boundaries** (no ambiguity)
✓ **Every film has a reason** (auteur, canon, texture, or pleasure)
✓ **Caps prevent bloat** (no "completionist" sprawl)
✓ **Decades = waves** (historical coherence, not arbitrary dates)

## FINAL NOTES

### What Makes This System Work

**1. Identity-Driven, Not Completionist**
- Core = who you are as a cinephile
- Satellite = margins you find interesting
- Popcorn = pleasure without guilt
- Reference = canon obligation (kept tight)

**2. Decade as Historical Wave**
- 1960s = modernist rupture
- 1970s = political cinema boom
- 1980s = postmodern genre turn
- Not just date organization - conceptual organization

**3. Caps Enforce Curation**
- Brazilian exploitation capped at 45 (not 200)
- Reference capped at 50 (not 150)
- Every tier has limits
- Forces you to cut weak films

**4. Monthly Review Prevents Drift**
- Staging can't grow forever
- Every month: promote or cut
- New downloads → Staging first
- Nothing escapes evaluation

### The Archive You've Built

This isn't just organized files.

This is a **museum** of:
- Modernist cinema (1960s Core)
- Political cinema (1970s Core)
- Postmodern genre (1980s Core/Satellite)
- Global arthouse (1990s Core)
- Commercial cinema (Popcorn across decades)
- Exploitation margins (Satellite across decades)
- Classical canon (Reference)

**It's a complete cinema archive with a coherent thesis.**

---

## PROJECT STATUS: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

All planning complete. All rules defined. All films sorted or staged.

**You now have:**
- Complete folder structure
- Complete tier definitions
- Complete sorting manifest
- Complete maintenance plan
- Complete future development plan (Popcorn thesis)

**Next:** Begin physical file organization or continue with Phase 3 (Staging Triage).

---

**Your decade-driven, wave-structured cinema archive is now fully defined.**

**The library IS the thesis.**
