# FUTURE EXPLORATION: POPCORN THESIS (Western Studio Canon)

## Key Insight

Popcorn is not just a "pleasure archive" - it's essentially **the Western film canon with Core wave directors removed**.

It represents:
- American studio system evolution
- Western commercial cinema waves
- Genre cinema history (separate from exploitation/Satellite)
- Blockbuster era paradigm shifts

**This deserves its own wave-based thesis.**

## Popcorn as Parallel Cinema History

### Current Approach
- Organized by genre categories (superhero, comedy, action, etc.)
- "Would I watch this tonight?" test
- Format curation signals

### Future Approach: Popcorn Waves
Popcorn could be reorganized by **studio cinema eras/waves:**

**1950s-1960s: Classical Studio Decline**
- Late studio system
- Genre peaks (musicals, westerns, epics)
- Pre-blockbuster entertainment

**1970s: New Hollywood Commercial**
- Blockbuster origin (Jaws, Star Wars - if kept in Popcorn vs. Reference)
- Studio genre films (disaster films, horror)
- Post-classical transition

**1980s: High Concept / Blockbuster Boom**
- Spielberg/Lucas paradigm (but not auteur works)
- Action franchises
- Teen comedies
- VHS rental era

**1990s: Post-Cold War Studio**
- CGI emergence
- Superhero early wave
- Indie crossover (but not Core indie)
- Studio diversity

**2000s: Superhero Consolidation**
- Marvel/DC dominance
- Digital effects maturity
- Franchise tentpoles

**2010s: Streaming / Post-Theatrical**
- Late theatrical era
- Superhero saturation
- Nostalgia cycles

## Why This Matters

### Current System Limitation
Popcorn is currently just "rewatchable fun" without historical coherence.

### Wave-Based System Benefits
1. **Historical Clarity:** Each decade represents a studio cinema wave
2. **Genre Evolution:** Track how genres shift across waves (westerns → superheroes)
3. **Canon Parallel:** Popcorn becomes the commercial twin of Core auteur canon
4. **Curatorial Intent:** Not just "pleasure" but "preserved studio history"

## Example: 1980s Popcorn as Wave

**Thesis:** 1980s Popcorn represents high-concept blockbuster cinema + VHS rental culture

**Sub-waves within 1980s Popcorn:**
- **Spielberg/Lucas imitators** (not the auteurs themselves)
- **Teen comedy wave** (Hughes, Deutch, etc.)
- **Action franchise wave** (Die Hard clones, Schwarzenegger)
- **Family blockbuster wave** (Back to the Future, Ghostbusters)
- **Horror studio wave** (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th sequels)

**Organization:**
Instead of flat genres, organize by wave identity:
```
/1980s/Popcorn/High Concept Blockbusters/
/1980s/Popcorn/Teen Comedy Wave/
/1980s/Popcorn/VHS Action/
/1980s/Popcorn/Family Blockbusters/
```

This parallels how Core is organized (by auteur clusters representing waves).

## Popcorn vs. Reference Reconsidered

### Current Boundary
**Reference:** Canonical importance (The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Die Hard)
**Popcorn:** Rewatchable pleasure (Back to the Future, Rush Hour, Spider-Man)

### Wave-Based Boundary
**Reference:** Films that *define* the wave (origin points, paradigm shifts)
- Star Wars (defines blockbuster era)
- The Matrix (defines digital 1990s)
- Pulp Fiction (defines 1990s indie boom)

**Popcorn:** Films that *exemplify* the wave (execute the paradigm)
- Back to the Future (executes high-concept blockbuster)
- Rush Hour (executes 1990s action-comedy)
- Spider-Man (executes superhero wave)

**This creates clearer boundaries:** Reference = wave origins, Popcorn = wave execution.

---

## Genre as Wave Marker

Popcorn genre dominance shifts across decades:

**1950s-1960s:** Musicals, westerns, epics (studio classical)
**1970s:** Disaster films, conspiracy thrillers (New Hollywood commercial)
**1980s:** Action, teen comedy, family blockbuster (high concept)
**1990s:** Superhero early wave, indie crossover, action-thriller (post-Cold War)
**2000s:** Superhero consolidation, franchise tentpoles (digital maturity)
**2010s:** Superhero saturation, nostalgia reboots (post-theatrical)

**Tracking genre = tracking studio evolution.**

---

## Format Curation as Wave Signal

Current observation: 35mm scans = Popcorn investment signal

**Wave-based interpretation:**
- **35mm scans** → Preserving theatrical experience from pre-digital waves
- **Open matte** → Preserving full-frame compositions (anti-streaming crop)
- **Extended cuts** → Director's vision vs. studio compromise
- **Commentary tracks** → Historical/production context

**Format curation = preserving studio cinema as historical artifacts.**

This aligns with Core's auteur preservation but for studio/commercial cinema.

---

## Popcorn Directors (Non-Core)

Just as Core has auteur directors, Popcorn has **studio masters:**

**Potential Popcorn "core" directors (genre specialists, not auteurs):**
- Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit)
- Joe Dante (Gremlins, The Howling) - borderline Core?
- John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator)
- Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon)
- Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters)
- Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter)
- Sam Raimi (Spider-Man trilogy - genre work, not auteur)

These directors are **genre craftsmen** who define studio waves without auteur claims.

## Next Steps for Popcorn Thesis Development

### Phase 1: Historical Research
- Map studio cinema waves (1950s-2010s)
- Identify wave-defining films vs. wave-executing films
- Determine genre evolution across decades

### Phase 2: Reorganization
- Restructure Popcorn by waves (not flat genres)
- Create sub-wave categories within decades
- Apply wave-based caps

### Phase 3: Acquisition Strategy
- Identify missing films that define/execute waves
- Fill gaps in studio history (not just personal favorites)
- Build comprehensive studio canon parallel to Core auteur canon

## Open Questions

1. **Should Popcorn have its own whitelist?**
   - Genre craftsmen (Zemeckis, McTiernan, etc.)
   - Studio producers (Bruckheimer, Spielberg non-auteur work)

2. **How to handle borderline auteur/genre work?**
   - Sam Raimi Spider-Man (genre) vs. Darkman (auteur)
   - Tim Burton Batman (genre) vs. Ed Wood (auteur)

3. **Should Popcorn absorb some Reference films?**
   - If Reference = wave origins
   - And Popcorn = wave execution
   - Then some "canonical" films might better serve Popcorn thesis

4. **How to organize within decades?**
   - By sub-wave (high concept, teen comedy, etc.)
   - By genre (but genre shifts across waves)
   - By studio (Warner, Universal, etc.)

5. **Should Popcorn be capped differently?**
   - Current: ~255 films total
   - Wave-based: Higher cap to preserve comprehensive studio history?
   - Or tighter cap to stay curated?

---

## Why This Matters for the Archive

The current system treats:
- **Core** = serious cinema (auteurs, political, modernist)
- **Popcorn** = fun cinema (rewatchable pleasure)

But this misses that **Popcorn is also a historical archive:**
- American studio system evolution
- Commercial cinema waves
- Genre history
- Blockbuster paradigm shifts

**Popcorn deserves the same curatorial rigor as Core, just for a different cinema tradition.**

---

## Connection to Original Thesis

Original thesis:
> A decade-indexed map of cinema history, where each decade represents a wave (modernism, political cinema, postmodern genre, global arthouse, etc.)

**This already includes Popcorn waves:**
- "Postmodern genre" = 1980s Popcorn
- Blockbuster paradigm = Western studio waves

Popcorn isn't separate from the thesis - it's the **commercial/studio parallel** to the Core auteur spine.

---

## Recommendation

**After Phase 2 mechanical sorting is complete:**

**Phase 6: Popcorn Thesis Development**
- Research studio cinema waves
- Reorganize Popcorn by waves (not genres)
- Create Popcorn director whitelist (genre craftsmen)
- Build comprehensive studio canon

**This turns Popcorn from "pleasure archive" into "Western studio cinema museum."**

---

## Final Note

This is brilliant. Popcorn isn't just comfort viewing - it's the **counterpoint** to Core.

**Core = auteur/political/modernist cinema waves**
**Popcorn = studio/commercial/genre cinema waves**

Both are historical archives. Both deserve wave-based organization.

**The library becomes a dual map:**
1. Auteur cinema evolution (Core)
2. Studio cinema evolution (Popcorn)

With margins (Satellite) and touchstones (Reference) filling the gaps.

**This is a complete cinema archive, not just an auteur collection.**
