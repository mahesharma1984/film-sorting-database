# Satellite Depth: Applying Core/Reference Logic Within Categories

> A Satellite category is not a filing cabinet. It is a tradition. Traditions have masters, practitioners, and texture — and the ability to distinguish between them is what turns a collection into a critical argument.

---

## 1. The Recursive Insight

The four-tier logic of this archive (Core → Reference → Satellite → Popcorn) is not a one-time sorting operation. It is a recursive principle: the same distinction between depth of engagement — between master and practitioner, between canon and texture — applies at every scale of organisation.

At the whole-archive level:
- **Core** = directors whose full body of work this archive is committed to
- **Reference** = canonical films by non-Core directors; the conversation you must know
- **Satellite** = traditions that contextualise the Core; exploitation, margins, waves
- **Popcorn** = rewatchable pleasure cinema

At the Satellite category level, the same structure applies:
- **Category Core** = directors who defined or transformed the tradition; whose formal language is what the category means
- **Category Reference** = essential films that establish what the tradition contains; the conversation within the tradition you must know
- **Category texture** = skilled practitioners, interesting experiments, historical completeness

This is not a new taxonomy layered on top of the existing one. It is the same taxonomy applied with greater resolution. As your engagement with a Satellite category deepens, the distinction between these levels becomes visible. The act of naming them — formally vetting what belongs at each level — is how connoisseurship crystallises into curatorial structure.

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

Six frameworks from film studies, philosophy, and the theory of knowledge ground this recursive approach:

### Sarris and the Auteur Pantheon

Andrew Sarris's *The American Cinema* (1968) established the foundational method. Sarris created a four-tiered ranking of American directors — Pantheon, Exceptional Talents, Interesting Directors, Competent Technicians — and applied it to the full history of Hollywood cinema. His insight was that auteur criticism requires ranking; a flat list of "good directors" is not a critical argument.

Your archive does for a personal collection what Sarris did for American cinema: it establishes a ranked argument. Within a Satellite category, Sarris's logic applies directly. Giallo has its Pantheon (Bava, Argento), its Exceptional Talents (Fulci, Martino, Soavi), its Interesting Directors (Lenzi, Lado), its texture. Naming these distinctions is the act of critical authority.

### Bloom and the Anxiety of Influence

Harold Bloom's *The Anxiety of Influence* (1973) argues that canons form through influence and response: strong artists struggle against their predecessors, transforming what they inherit. A canon is not a list of masterpieces. It is a record of how the strongest artists in a tradition changed what was possible.

Within a Satellite category, the same structure applies. Argento did not ignore Bava. He responded to him, extended what he had established, and eventually transformed it in ways Bava could not have anticipated. Understanding Argento requires understanding what he was anxiously overcoming. The within-category Core directors are those whose work sets the terms that others must respond to — not by being imitated, but by being the unavoidable prior art.

### Bourdieu and Connoisseurship

Pierre Bourdieu's *Distinction* (1979) argues that connoisseurship — the ability to make fine discriminations within a category — develops through sustained exposure. An expert in Pinku Eiga can distinguish Wakamatsu's political interventionism from Kumashiro's erotic formalism at a glance, not through abstract knowledge but through the accumulation of perceptual patterns built by watching dozens of films.

The within-category vetting process is simply the formalisation of what connoisseurship already knows intuitively. When your engagement with a Satellite category reaches the point where you have genuine opinions about its internal hierarchies — when you can argue not just that Bava is important but *why* his visual language is foundational and what Argento changed — you are ready to encode those distinctions in the archive.

### Baxandall and the Period Eye

Michael Baxandall's *Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy* (1972) describes the "period eye": the trained capacity to see what a work is doing, in the context of the problems it was solving. Greatness is historically specific. Bava's innovations in Giallo make sense only against the technological and industrial constraints of Italian cinema in the 1960s. His mastery of shadow and colour was not timeless virtuosity — it was the best available solution to the specific problems of low-budget 1960s Italian genre filmmaking.

This matters for within-category vetting because it shapes how you apply the criteria. You are not ranking directors against each other on an absolute scale. You are recognising what each one achieved given the constraints of their moment. Bava in 1963 and Argento in 1982 are great in historically distinct ways.

### Foucault and Emergence

Michel Foucault's archaeological method (*The Archaeology of Knowledge*, 1969) argues that categories are recognised, not invented. The structure of knowledge reveals itself through the accumulated material. You do not impose "Core of Giallo" from outside — you recognise it from the pattern of the films you have.

This is precisely how the within-category vetting works in practice. You do not decide in advance who the masters of Giallo are. You watch the films. You notice who keeps appearing at the moments when the category changed — who set the terms, who transformed them. The category structure declares itself through the material.

### Altman and Genre Evolution

Rick Altman's *Film/Genre* (1999) argues that genres are not static containers. They evolve historically: each era produces different conventions, different problems, different directors who define what a genre means. Understanding a genre requires tracing this evolution.

Within-category vetting informed by Altman identifies not just great directors but directors who mark the genre's turning points. Bava establishes the visual grammar of Giallo in the early 1960s. Argento pushes it toward psychological abstraction in the 1970s. Fulci brings baroque excess in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Soavi represents the final formal refinement in the late 1980s before the tradition exhausts itself. Each is important at a specific moment in the genre's evolution. Your within-category Core/Reference structure can encode this temporal sequence.

## 3. The Four Criteria for Within-Category Core Status

The same four criteria that define global Core status (inferred in AUTEUR_CRITERIA.md) apply within a Satellite category. A director earns within-category Core status when all four hold:

**Criterion 1: Sustained body of work within the category**
Multiple films in the tradition, across multiple years. A director with 2–3 films in a category is a practitioner. A director with 8–15 films who returned to the form repeatedly across a career is committed to it. That commitment earns Core consideration.

**Criterion 2: Formal distinctiveness within the category**
A recognisable visual, narrative, or thematic language specific to their work in this tradition. Not just "good at the genre" but "their way of doing the genre is so particular that you can identify their films without credits." Bava's shadow play is distinctive. Argento's kinetic precision is distinctive. A director whose films are well-executed but indistinguishable from other practitioners' work is Reference at best, texture at worst.

**Criterion 3: Influence on how the category is understood**
Later directors in the tradition are responding to them — consciously or not. The category's visual and narrative conventions were shaped by their work. Remove them from the category and the category looks different. This is the Bloom criterion: Core directors within a category are the ones whose influence creates the "anxiety" that later directors are working through.

**Criterion 4: Your personal engagement depth**
You have sought out multiple films, including non-canonical ones. You have opinions about their work that go beyond recognition. You can argue about them. This is the Bourdieu criterion: within-category Core status requires you to have developed the connoisseurship to identify it. If you have only seen two Bava films, Bava is Reference for you. When you have seen twelve and can articulate why his use of colour was unprecedented in Italian cinema, he is Core.

### Reference tier within a category

Directors (or specific films) with historical importance, recognisable quality, and belonging to the tradition — but who do not redefine the form. They execute it brilliantly, extend it in specific directions, or represent important historical moments. Essential to know if you are serious about the category, but not the directors whose formal language defines what the category means.

### Texture

Skilled practitioners, interesting experiments, historically necessary examples, one-offs. Films that are in the category because they demonstrably belong there, but directed by people who worked in the idiom without distinctive voice or career commitment. These are not lesser films — they are the field that the masters worked within. The texture makes the masters visible.

## 4. Case Studies

### Giallo

| Level | Directors / Films | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Category Core | Mario Bava, Dario Argento | Bava establishes the visual grammar (1963–1975); Argento transforms and deepens it (1970–1995). Remove either and Giallo looks structurally different. |
| Category Reference | Lucio Fulci (*Don't Torture a Duckling*, *The New York Ripper*), Sergio Martino (*All the Colors of the Dark*, *Torso*), Michele Soavi (*Stagefright*) | Important films that demonstrate range and evolution. Essential to understanding the tradition but secondary to the defining voices. |
| Texture | Aldo Lado, Umberto Lenzi, Massimo Dallamano | Skilled practitioners working competently within the established idiom. Historically significant, formally unremarkable. |

**The Core's shadow:** Giallo is the shadow of Italian modernism — Antonioni, Fellini. The genre tradition that Italian art cinema implicitly repudiated. Understanding Bava and Argento requires knowing what they were *not* trying to be, and occasionally, secretly, what they wanted to equal.

### Pinku Eiga

| Level | Directors / Films | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Category Core | Kōji Wakamatsu, Masao Adachi | Political interventionists who used the pink film form as cover for genuinely radical filmmaking. Their formal ambitions exceed the genre's commercial expectations. |
| Category Reference | Tatsumi Kumashiro (*Ichijo's Wet Lust*), Noboru Tanaka (*A Woman Called Sada Abe*) | Masters of erotic formalism within the genre conventions. Essential and technically accomplished; less politically transformative. |
| Texture | Roman Porno studio output | The commercial films that made the industry viable, within which the masters operated. |

**The Core's shadow:** Pinku Eiga is the shadow of Japanese New Wave. Oshima, Imamura, and Yoshida made politically radical films about sexuality through the art cinema route. Wakamatsu made them through the exploitation route. The shadow defines the territory.

### Hong Kong Action (proposed)

| Level | Directors / Films | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Category Core | Tsui Hark, John Woo | Hark's visual invention defines what HK action looks like in the 1980s; Woo's formal refinement (kinetics, slow-motion choreography, Catholic imagery) transforms the genre internationally. |
| Category Reference | Ringo Lam (*City on Fire*), Johnnie To (*The Mission*), Lam Nai-Choi (*The Story of Ricky*) | Directors with distinctive voices and important films; key to the tradition's breadth. |
| Texture | Category III commercial output, martial arts formula films | The industrial production base that made the genre viable and through which the masters operated. |

### American New Hollywood (proposed, in progress)

| Level | Directors / Films | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Category Core | Bob Fosse, Hal Ashby, Alan Pakula | Fosse's formal integration of song, dance, and narrative death; Ashby's Buddhist detachment applied to American realism; Pakula's paranoia aesthetic. Each defines a distinct formal possibility for the 1970s prestige film. |
| Category Reference | Sydney Pollack (*Three Days of the Condor*), Sidney Lumet (*Network*, *Dog Day Afternoon*), Peter Bogdanovich (*Targets*, *Paper Moon*) | Important directors with canonical films; skilled practitioners of the New Hollywood idiom without the formal distinctiveness of the Core tier. |
| Texture | General prestige output 1965–1985 | Films that demonstrate the industrial moment without being shaped by a distinctive authorial voice. |

**The Core's shadow:** American New Hollywood is the shadow of American exploitation (and vice versa). They are two responses to the same post-Production Code moment. New Hollywood directors borrowed energy and audience from the exploitation circuit. Cassavetes and Russ Meyer are not opposites — they are two ends of the same liberation from the Hays Code.

## 5. The Seeking Strategy

Within-category vetting does not just organise what you have. It generates a method for finding what you need.

**Horizontal seeking** — the existing mode: you have one Godard film, you seek the rest of his filmography. You move across a director's body of work.

**Vertical seeking** — the mode this document enables: you have a Satellite category (Giallo), you deepen your engagement with it, you identify the Category Core directors (Bava, Argento), and their filmographies become your acquisition list. You seek out everything by the masters of the tradition.

The seeking sequence:
1. Accumulate films in a category (initial collection)
2. Patterns emerge: some directors keep appearing at pivotal moments
3. Formal vetting: apply the four criteria to candidate directors
4. Identify Category Core directors
5. Their complete filmographies become the acquisition target for this category
6. As engagement deepens, evaluate whether any Category Core directors should be promoted to global Core

This is the pipeline:

```
Satellite texture → watch more → Category Reference films → watch more →
Category Core directors → full filmographies → potential promotion to global Core
```

The within-category vetting is not a retroactive filing exercise. It is an active seeking programme. Once you know who the masters of a tradition are, you know what to find.

## 6. How Exploitation Directors Become Auteurs

A documented historical pattern: directors who work in exploitation genres are not initially treated as auteurs. They are seen as commercial filmmakers producing formula product. Over time, as critical discourse matures and the genre's depth is recognised, some directors are elevated to auteur status.

**The elevation mechanism:**
1. **Formal distinctiveness recognised:** Critics identify a visual or narrative language specific to the director, not just to the genre
2. **Body of work studied:** Enough films are preserved and accessible that career-spanning analysis becomes possible
3. **Critical reframing:** Serious critics (often from Cahiers du Cinéma or equivalent) write about the director's work as formally ambitious, not merely technically competent
4. **Retrospectives:** Major institutions programme career-spanning retrospectives, which legitimise the director's status
5. **Cross-category influence:** Other directors (outside the category) acknowledge or demonstrate influence

Mario Bava was elevated through this process across the 1970s–1990s. Dario Argento through the 1980s–2000s. Tsui Hark and John Woo through the global Hong Kong Action boom of the 1990s. Each followed the same arc: commercial genre filmmaker → recognised formal innovator → retrospective subject → acknowledged auteur.

Your within-category vetting carries out step 1 of this process privately: formal distinctiveness recognised. The archive is your critical argument. When you identify Bava as Category Core in Giallo, you are making the same claim that Laura Mulvey made in print. You are just making it organisationally rather than rhetorically.

The potential for promotion to global Core is step 5 of the elevation process. If your engagement with a Category Core director deepens to the point where you are seeking their complete filmography, they have crossed the threshold.

## 7. Cross-Application: Encoding the Within-Category Hierarchy

Once the within-category vetting is complete for a Satellite category, it is encoded in three places:

**SORTING_DATABASE.md (highest trust, human-curated):**
Films whose within-category tier is certain are added with explicit destinations. This overrides automated routing.

```
# Giallo — Category Core directors (full filmographies)
Blood and Black Lace (1964) | Satellite/Giallo/Core Tier/
Bay of Blood (1971) | Satellite/Giallo/Core Tier/
Deep Red (1975) | Satellite/Giallo/Core Tier/
Suspiria (1977) | Satellite/Giallo/Core Tier/
```

**lib/constants.py (routing rules for new files):**
Add Category Core director names to the routing rules for automated classification of new acquisitions.

```python
# SATELLITE_ROUTING_RULES: within-category depth encoding
'Giallo': {
    'country_codes': ['IT'],
    'decades': ['1960s', '1970s', '1980s'],
    'genres': ['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Mystery'],
    'directors': ['bava', 'argento', 'fulci', 'martino', 'soavi', 'lenzi'],
    'core_directors': ['bava', 'argento'],  # within-category Core
},
```

**Folder structure (optional, for categories with sufficient depth):**
When a Satellite category reaches sufficient size and the within-category hierarchy is stable, the folder can be subdivided:
```
Satellite/Giallo/
  Core Tier/       ← Bava, Argento complete filmographies
  Reference/       ← Fulci, Martino, Soavi canonical films
  1960s/           ← decade-sorted texture
  1970s/
  1980s/
```

This is not required for every category. It is appropriate when the Category Core directors have filmographies large enough to warrant their own space, and when the distinction between Core and texture is clearly established.

---

## 8. The Monthly Review as Vetting Practice

Within-category vetting is not a one-time operation. It is continuous. TIER_ARCHITECTURE.md describes the monthly review cycle:

> Films can move: Promotion (Satellite → Core), Reclassification (any tier → any tier), Demotion (/Out) — when interest wanes.

The same movement happens within categories:
- A director you initially placed as texture reveals more depth on second viewing: promote to Category Reference
- A director you initially placed as Category Core is revealed through further watching to be executing a formula rather than inventing it: demote to Reference
- A Category Core director's engagement deepens beyond Satellite into identity: promote to global Core

The monthly review is also when new films entering a category are evaluated not just by routing rules but by within-category standing. A new Argento film arrives: it goes to Giallo, yes, but it also goes to Category Core — because you know who Argento is within the tradition.

---

## 9. Relationship to the Refinement Process

REFINEMENT_AND_EMERGENCE.md documents how macro categories split into micro categories. This document is about the complementary movement: how micro categories develop internal depth.

The two processes are related:

**Refinement (macro → micro):** Satellite splits into named categories. American Exploitation splits into AmEx + Classic Hollywood + American New Hollywood. Each split is driven by density, coherence, and archival necessity.

**Depth (micro → structured):** Named categories develop within-category hierarchies. Giallo develops Core/Reference/texture structure. Pinku Eiga develops its internal masters. American New Hollywood develops its Core directors.

Together, they describe how a collection matures:
1. Films arrive
2. Macro categories organise them at the highest level
3. Micro categories split off when patterns are dense enough to name
4. Within each micro category, internal hierarchies develop through connoisseurship
5. Category Core directors may be promoted to global Core as engagement deepens
6. New films arrive and the cycle continues

The end state is not a finished taxonomy. It is a living system in which every level of organisation reflects the actual depth of engagement. The collection tells the truth about what you know and care about.

## Summary

| Principle | Statement |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Recursive canonisation** | The Core/Reference logic applies at every level: whole archive, Satellite category, potential sub-category |
| **Four criteria for Category Core** | Sustained body of work, formal distinctiveness, influence on the tradition, personal engagement depth |
| **Two tiers within a category** | Category Core (defines the tradition) and Category Reference (essential to the tradition) |
| **Texture is not lesser** | Texture is the field that makes the masters visible. It is what the masters worked within and against. |
| **Vertical seeking** | Identifying Category Core directors generates an acquisition programme: seek their complete filmographies |
| **Elevation pathway** | Satellite texture → Category Reference → Category Core → potential global Core promotion |
| **The shadow principle applies within** | Every Category Core director is the shadow of something in global Core. Identify the relationship. |
| **Encode when stable** | SORTING_DATABASE.md for certain cases, constants.py for rules, folder structure for mature categories |
| **Monthly review applies within** | Within-category vetting is continuous, not a one-time sort |
