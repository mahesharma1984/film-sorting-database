# Tier Architecture: The Four-Tier System

> The four tiers are not quality rankings. They are four distinct curatorial relationships a collector can have with a film.

This essay covers the tier system in three parts: why four tiers and how they interact (Part I), what makes a director Core (Part II), and how Popcorn constitutes a parallel cinema history (Part III).

---

# Part I: Why Four Tiers, Why These Ratios

## 1. Tiers as Relationships

Every film in the archive has a relationship to the collector. The four tiers name four kinds of relationship:

| Tier | Relationship | In plain language |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Core** | Identity | "This filmmaker is part of who I am" |
| **Satellite** | Interest | "This is a margin I find compelling" |
| **Popcorn** | Pleasure | "I rewatch this for fun" |
| **Reference** | Acknowledgment | "Cinema history requires I keep this" |

These are not degrees of the same thing. They are categorically different relationships. A Godard film is not "more liked" than a Spider-Man film — it is liked in a fundamentally different way. The tier system names this difference instead of collapsing it into a single scale.

---

## 2. Why Exactly Four?

**Why not three?** Collapsing Satellite and Popcorn into a single "Non-Core" tier would conflate two genuinely different relationships. Brazilian pornochanchada and Back to the Future serve completely different functions in the archive. One is texture — historical context for the 1970s exploitation boom. The other is pleasure — a film you actually put on for enjoyment. Merging them loses information.

**Why not five?** The most tempting fifth tier would be "Avant-Garde" — separating experimental cinema (Warhol, Brakhage) from narrative art cinema (Godard, Yang). But the whitelist already handles this: Warhol is a Core auteur. His formal radicalism does not separate him from the auteur thesis — it intensifies it. Adding a fifth tier would create a distinction the collection does not actually need.

**[YOUR INPUT: Did you ever consider a different tier structure? A fifth tier? Merging tiers? Was the four-tier system designed from the start, or did it emerge during the sorting process? The design history would strengthen this argument. If you initially had three tiers and found you needed to split something, that tells a story about why four is the right number.]**

---

## 3. The Decision Tree as Philosophical Statement

The classification system checks tiers in a specific order:

1. **Core first** — Is the director on the whitelist?
2. **Reference second** — Is the film in the reference canon?
3. **Popcorn third** — Does it pass the tonight test? (mainstream popularity + format signals)
4. **Satellite fourth** — Does the film match a satellite category (country, decade, director)?
5. **Unsorted last** — If nothing matches, stage for manual review.

This priority order is not an implementation detail. It is a philosophical statement: **identity trumps everything**. A Kubrick film is Core even if it is also canonical (could be Reference), even if it is genre cinema (could be Satellite), even if it is rewatchable comfort viewing (could be Popcorn). The auteur relationship takes priority because the archive is, first and last, an auteur thesis.

Reference comes second because canonical status is more durable than genre classification or personal pleasure. Popcorn comes third because mainstream popularity signals are checked before the more specific Satellite routing — this prevents well-known films with high vote counts from being absorbed by Satellite categories (Issue #14). Satellite comes fourth because its historically-bounded routing is the most specific and context-dependent check. Unsorted collects everything the system cannot confidently classify.

The decision tree is the tier architecture expressed as algorithm.

---

## 4. Tier Interactions

The tiers define each other through mutual exclusion:

- **Core** is not just "auteur films." It is auteur films that are not Reference canon (Citizen Kane is Reference, not Core, even though Welles is an auteur — because Welles is not on your whitelist).
- **Reference** is not just "important films." It is important films by directors not on the Core whitelist (Psycho is Reference; if Hitchcock were on the whitelist, it would be Core).
- **Satellite** is not just "exploitation." It is exploitation that is not Popcorn (Rush Hour is Popcorn despite having Hong Kong action DNA, because it is rewatchable studio entertainment).
- **Popcorn** is not just "fun." It is fun films that are not Core, Reference, or Satellite (The Big Lebowski is fun but goes to Core because the Coen Brothers are on the whitelist).

Every tier boundary is a decision about which relationship takes priority. The boundaries are not arbitrary — they follow the decision tree's priority logic. This means the tiers form a system, not a list.

---

## 5. Caps as System Constraints

Each tier has explicit or implicit caps:

| Tier | Cap | Mechanism |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Core | ~140 | Implicitly capped by the whitelist (~40 directors) |
| Reference | 50 | Hard cap — "prevents 'important' from becoming bloat" |
| Satellite | ~435 | Sum of 16 category caps (13 with individual caps; 3 categories uncapped) |
| Popcorn | ~255 | Sum of 10 genre caps (Comedy 50, Action 30, Superhero 25, etc.) |

Caps serve a structural purpose: they prevent any tier from overwhelming the others. Without the Reference cap, "important" films would creep to 200 and drown the personal voice. Without Satellite category caps, a casual interest in Hong Kong action could inflate to 300 films and overpower the auteur spine.

Caps enforce a principle: every tier must earn its space. When a Satellite category exceeds its cap, the weakest film gets cut — not shelved, but removed. This makes the cap not just a limit but a forcing function for curatorial quality.

---

## 6. The Ratio Question

The current distribution:

| Tier | Films | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Core | ~140 | 26% |
| Satellite | ~240 | 45% |
| Popcorn | ~100 | 19% |
| Reference | ~50 | 9% |

**[YOUR INPUT: Is this distribution designed or emergent?**

Three possible readings:

**If designed:** You set out to have Satellite be the largest tier. The argument would be that margins SHOULD outnumber identity — a collection with more texture than spine is more interesting than a collection that is all spine. You are drawn to more things than you are obsessed with, and the ratio reflects that honestly.

**If emergent:** The caps were set, the films were sorted, and this is what fell out. The argument would be that the system discovered an organic truth about the collection's character. You happen to have more exploitation cinema than auteur cinema, and the ratio reflects your actual collecting history.

**If both:** The caps were designed to constrain, but within those constraints, the actual ratio reveals something about you as a collector. The system was designed to be discoverable — the architecture channels, and the content reveals.

**Which is it? The answer matters for whether the ratios are prescriptive (other collections should aim for similar proportions) or descriptive (this is what one particular collection looks like).]**

---

## 7. Tier Density Across Decades

The tier ratios are not uniform across decades — they shift to reflect each decade's character:

| Decade | Core | Satellite | Popcorn | Reference | Character |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1960s | Dominant | Present | Minimal | Present | Auteur decade — modernist rupture is primarily a Core phenomenon |
| 1970s | Strong | **Peak** | Moderate | Present | Dual peak — auteurs AND exploitation at maximum density |
| 1980s | Moderate | High | **Peak** | Present | Genre decade — VHS/blockbuster culture dominates |
| 1990s | High | High | High | Present | Balanced — all traditions coexist |
| 2000s+ | Selective | Moderate | Moderate | Sparse | Thinning — the present is harder to judge |

This variation is evidence that the tier system is responsive to historical reality, not imposed onto it. The 1960s really was an auteur-dominated era. The 1980s really was a genre-dominated era. The tiers capture this.

---

## 8. Permeable Boundaries

The tier architecture is a living system, not a fixed taxonomy. Films and directors can move:

**Promotion (Satellite → Core):** "If director becomes auteur obsession, promote to Core." When casual interest in an exploitation director deepens into genuine engagement with their full body of work, the relationship changes from "interest" to "identity," and the tier follows. (See also: [SATELLITE_DEPTH.md](SATELLITE_DEPTH.md) §5–6 — the within-category vetting pathway that precedes global Core promotion.)

**Reclassification (any tier → any tier):** Monthly review can reclassify films. A film you thought was Popcorn might reveal itself as Reference after you realize its historical significance. A Satellite film might get cut to /Out when you realize you kept it from obligation, not interest.

**Demotion (/Out):** Films that fail to justify their presence get cut. The 30-day quarantine in /Out prevents hasty deletions. But the archive is not a one-way ratchet — things leave as well as enter.

This permeability is important because it means the tier architecture describes relationships as they are now, not as they were when a film was first classified. The system tracks the collector's evolving understanding.

---

# Part II: Core — The Auteur Criteria

> The Core whitelist is not a list of the best directors. It is a statement of curatorial identity — "these are the filmmakers whose work defines my understanding of cinema history."

## 9. The Whitelist as Thesis

The Core director whitelist (~38-43 directors) is the single most consequential curatorial decision in the archive. It determines which films automatically receive the highest tier, which filmmakers constitute the collection's identity, and — read as a whole — what story the archive tells about cinema.

The whitelist is not a canon. Canons claim objectivity ("these are the great directors"). The whitelist claims identity ("these are MY directors"). This distinction matters because it shifts the burden of proof. A canon must justify every inclusion against universal criteria. A whitelist must justify every inclusion against the collector's thesis about cinema history.

The thesis, expressed through the whitelist: cinema history from the 1950s to the 2010s is a story of auteurs who broke open classical form (1960s), politicized it (1970s), pushed it to the margins (1980s), and globalized it (1990s). The whitelist is the cast of characters in that story.

---

## 10. The Narrative Arc

Read chronologically, the whitelist traces a narrative:

**1960s: Modernist Rupture.** Godard, Rivette, Melville, Pasolini, Antonioni, Resnais, Varda, Suzuki, Demy, Fellini, Kubrick, Bertolucci. The largest director cohort in the archive. These filmmakers broke cinema open simultaneously across France, Italy, Japan, and the US/UK. The density is highest here because the modernist rupture was the most generative wave — the moment when everything changed.

**1970s: Political Cinema + Auteur Expansion.** Godard (political phase), Rivette, Ray, Cassavetes, Fassbinder, Akerman, Tarkovsky, Oshima, Duras, Malick, Scorsese, Bertolucci, Herzog, Fellini, Coppola, Kubrick, De Palma, Lumet, Morrissey. The political pressures of the era (Vietnam, Watergate, global upheaval) produce filmmakers who use cinema as a tool for interrogating power. New Hollywood converges with European political cinema.

**1980s: Postmodern Genre Turn.** Godard (late phase), Yang, Scorsese, Lynch, Coen Brothers, Jarmusch, Ruiz, Kubrick, Almodóvar, De Palma. The cohort shrinks. The auteur moves to the margins — Lynch works outside the studio system, Yang works in Taiwanese independence cinema, Jarmusch invents American indie minimalism. The studio system belongs to blockbusters now; the auteur occupies the edges.

**1990s: Global Arthouse Consolidation.** Godard, Yang, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Hartley, Coen Brothers, Jarmusch, Lynch, Rohmer, Denis, Malick, Kubrick, Kieślowski, P.T. Anderson, Almodóvar. The art film goes global. Taiwan (Yang, Hou), Hong Kong (Wong Kar-wai), Poland (Kieślowski) join the traditional European centers. American indie matures (Hartley, P.T. Anderson). The cohort is large again — not because of a single rupture but because multiple traditions converge.

**2000s-2010s: Late Digital / Festival Cinema.** Wong Kar-wai, Yang, Hou, Lynch, Malick, P.T. Anderson, Refn. The cohort thins to late-career auteurs producing final masterworks and a few newer voices. This may reflect the difficulty of judging the present, or it may reflect a genuine thinning of the auteur tradition in the digital era.

The narrative is not just a list. It is a STORY — about how cinema's artistic ambition moved from the center (1960s studio-adjacent modernism) to the margins (1980s independence) to global reach (1990s consolidation) to an uncertain present.

---

## 11. The Operational Rule

Once a director is on the whitelist, classification is mechanical:

> Any film by a whitelisted director in their relevant decade = automatic Core tier.

This is a deliberate separation of reasoning from precision. The REASONING happened once, when the director was evaluated for whitelist inclusion. It required cultural judgment, historical knowledge, and personal engagement. After that, every individual film classification is PRECISION — a binary lookup. Is the director on the list? Yes or no.

This design has a practical benefit: it eliminates case-by-case judgment for the ~140 Core films. You never have to decide whether THIS Godard film is "Core-worthy." Godard is Core. All his films are Core. The decision was made at the director level, not the film level.

---

## 12. Formal Criteria for Core Status

**[YOUR INPUT: This is the single most important gap in the theoretical framework. The whitelist exists, but the criteria for inclusion are nowhere stated explicitly. From analyzing the whitelist, I can infer several possible criteria — but these are inferences, not your stated principles. Please confirm, revise, or replace them.**

**Inferred Criterion 1: Sustained body of work.** Every Core director has multiple films in the collection. There are no one-hit-wonders on the whitelist. This suggests that Core status requires demonstrated commitment to filmmaking over time, not a single breakthrough.

**Inferred Criterion 2: Formal distinctiveness.** Every Core director has a recognizable visual, structural, or philosophical language. You can identify a Godard film, a Lynch film, a Wong Kar-wai film from a single frame. This suggests that Core status requires a personal cinematic language, not just "good films."

**Inferred Criterion 3: Relationship to a wave.** Every Core director either defines, extends, or disrupts the wave they belong to. Godard defines the 1960s rupture. Fassbinder extends political cinema into personal melodrama. Lynch disrupts the 1980s genre turn by making it strange. This suggests that Core status requires historical significance within a wave, not just individual achievement.

**Inferred Criterion 4: Personal investment.** The collector has engaged deeply with this filmmaker — watched multiple films, sought out obscure works, formed opinions about the career arc. This suggests that Core is partly autobiographical: these are directors you have a relationship with, not just directors you acknowledge.

**Are these the right criteria? Are there others? And how do they interact — does a director need ALL four, or is any one sufficient?]**

---

## 13. Boundary Cases

The boundary between Core and Satellite reveals the criteria by negative example:

**Warhol = Core. Russ Meyer = Satellite.** Both are prolific, recognizable, and historically significant. Both work in exploitation-adjacent territory. The implied distinction: Warhol's work connects to avant-garde/art-world discourse (fits the modernist thesis). Meyer's work is genre exploitation (texture, not identity).

**[YOUR INPUT: Is this the real reason? Or is it simpler — you are obsessed with Warhol's work (identity relationship) but interested in Meyer's work (texture relationship)? If the latter, the criterion is fundamentally about your relationship to the filmmaker, not about the filmmaker's objective status.]**

**Jodorowsky = Core. Tsui Hark = Satellite.** Both are auteurs with recognizable styles. The system classifies Jodorowsky as "auteur-driven cult" (Core) and Tsui Hark as "genre master" (Satellite). But both make highly personal genre-bending films.

**[YOUR INPUT: What separates "auteur-driven cult" from "genre master"? Is it that Jodorowsky's films are about Jodorowsky (personal vision imposed on genre material) while Tsui Hark's films are about the genre (elevating genre material through craft)? Or is it something else?]**

**Sam Raimi: Split across tiers.** Darkman and Evil Dead = auteur work (Core-adjacent or Satellite). Spider-Man = genre craftsmanship (Popcorn). One director, two (or three) tiers.

**[YOUR INPUT: How do you handle directors who straddle? The whitelist is per-director, but some directors have genuinely split careers. Is the whitelist too blunt an instrument for these cases?]**

---

## 14. Multi-Decade Presence

Some directors span multiple decades on the whitelist:

- **Jean-Luc Godard:** 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (five decades)
- **Stanley Kubrick:** 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s (four decades)
- **David Lynch:** 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (three decades)
- **Satyajit Ray:** 1950s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s (four decades)
- **Edward Yang:** 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (three decades)

Multi-decade presence is meaningful. It means the director's work tracks across multiple waves, serving as a connective thread through the archive. Godard across five decades is not just "a long career" — it is a thesis about how one filmmaker's evolution mirrors cinema's evolution. His 1960s work breaks modernism open; his 1970s work politicizes it; his 1980s-2000s work processes the aftermath. Following Godard through the archive IS following cinema history.

This is why the archive organizes by decade first, director second. The decade holds the wave context. The director provides the thread. Together they produce richer meaning than either alone.

---

## 15. The Whitelist Is Not Closed

The whitelist anticipates future growth. Directors currently marked for potential addition include:

- Abbas Kiarostami (1990s-2000s) — PRIORITY
- Tsai Ming-liang (1990s-2010s) — PRIORITY
- Apichatpong Weerasethakul (2000s-2010s) — PRIORITY
- Hong Sang-soo (2000s-2010s)
- Pedro Costa (2000s-2010s)
- Takeshi Kitano (1990s-2000s)
- Shohei Imamura (1960s-1970s)
- Kelly Reichardt (2000s-2010s)
- Jia Zhangke (2000s-2010s)
- Lucrecia Martel (2000s-2010s)

These additions are contingent on acquiring films, not on any theoretical barrier. The whitelist grows as the collection grows. A director becomes a candidate when the collector begins engaging with their work seriously enough that the relationship shifts from "acknowledged" to "essential."

The promotion path from Satellite also feeds the whitelist. A director who starts as Satellite texture (e.g., Wakamatsu, Candeias, Ferrara) can be promoted to Core when the collector's engagement deepens to the point of auteur obsession. The whitelist is a living document.

(See also: [SATELLITE_DEPTH.md](SATELLITE_DEPTH.md) §5–6 — the within-category vetting and seeking pathway through which exploitation directors accumulate the engagement that makes them Core candidates.)

# Part III: Popcorn — Studio Cinema as Parallel History

> Popcorn is not a lesser archive — it is the Western studio canon viewed as its own historical tradition, parallel to Core's auteur history.

## 16. Popcorn Is Not Just Pleasure

The simplest reading of the Popcorn tier is that it houses films you rewatch for fun. This is true but incomplete. Looked at structurally, Popcorn contains the Western film canon with Core auteur directors removed. What remains is not a random collection of guilty pleasures — it is the history of American studio cinema, organized by the same decade-wave logic that governs Core.

Core tracks how auteur cinema evolved from modernist rupture (1960s) through political cinema (1970s) to global arthouse (1990s). Popcorn, whether intentionally or not, tracks how studio cinema evolved from classical decline through the blockbuster boom to superhero consolidation. Both are historical archives. Both deserve wave-based organization.

The difference is not quality. It is tradition. Core documents cinema as art form. Popcorn documents cinema as industry. Together they form a dual map of how cinema actually works — never purely artistic, never purely commercial, always both.

---

## 17. Studio Cinema Has Its Own Waves

Just as Core decades carry wave labels (1960s = modernist rupture, 1970s = political cinema), Popcorn decades carry their own:

**1950s-1960s: Classical Studio Decline.** The late studio system producing its genre peaks — musicals, westerns, epics — before the old model collapses. Pre-blockbuster entertainment that now reads as a lost form.

**1970s: New Hollywood Commercial.** The blockbuster is born (Jaws, Star Wars), but so are disaster films, conspiracy thrillers, and the first post-classical studio genre experiments. The decade when the industry learns it can sell spectacle at scale.

**1980s: High Concept / Blockbuster Boom.** The Spielberg/Lucas paradigm produces imitators across every genre. Action franchises, teen comedies, family blockbusters, VHS rental culture. This is where the collection is heaviest in Popcorn (~80 films), and historically this makes sense — the 1980s is the peak of the studio entertainment machine.

**1990s: Post-Cold War Studio.** CGI emerges. The early superhero wave begins. Indie cinema crosses over into the mainstream. Studio output diversifies before consolidation narrows it again.

**2000s: Superhero Consolidation.** Marvel/DC dominance reshapes the industry. Digital effects mature. The franchise tentpole becomes the default studio product.

**2010s: Streaming / Post-Theatrical.** The theatrical model erodes. Superhero saturation sets in. Nostalgia cycles (reboots, legacy sequels) signal an industry looking backward.

These waves are not arbitrary — they correspond to real industrial, technological, and cultural shifts. The dominance of teen comedies in the 1980s is as historically specific as the dominance of giallo in the 1970s. Both are wave phenomena.

---

## 18. Reference as Wave Origins, Popcorn as Wave Execution

One of the harder boundary questions in the archive is Reference vs. Popcorn. Both contain Western studio films. Both can be rewatchable. The wave framework clarifies the distinction:

**Reference films define waves.** They are origin points and paradigm shifts — the films that create the template others follow. Star Wars defines the blockbuster era. The Matrix defines digital-era cinema. Pulp Fiction defines the 1990s indie-mainstream crossover. These films are kept not for pleasure but for historical necessity.

**Popcorn films execute waves.** They are the films that work within the paradigm, often brilliantly, without creating it. Back to the Future executes the high-concept blockbuster template. Rush Hour executes the 1990s action-comedy formula. Spider-Man executes the superhero wave.

This reframes the boundary: it is not about quality (Back to the Future is arguably a better film than many Reference entries) but about historical function. Did the film create the wave, or ride it?

---

## 19. Genre Dominance as Wave Marker

Tracking which genres dominate Popcorn in each decade reveals the wave structure:

- **1950s-1960s:** Musicals, westerns, epics (studio classical)
- **1970s:** Disaster films, conspiracy thrillers (New Hollywood commercial)
- **1980s:** Action, teen comedy, family blockbuster (high concept)
- **1990s:** Action-thriller, early superhero, indie crossover (post-Cold War)
- **2000s:** Superhero, franchise tentpoles (digital consolidation)
- **2010s:** Superhero saturation, nostalgia reboots (post-theatrical)

Genre is not eternal — it is wave-specific. The dominance of westerns in the 1950s and superheroes in the 2000s are both historically bounded phenomena. Tracking genre evolution across Popcorn decades IS tracking studio evolution.

---

## 20. Popcorn Directors vs. Core Auteurs

Core has auteurs — filmmakers with a recognizable personal vision who define or disrupt their wave. Popcorn has what might be called genre craftsmen — directors who define studio waves through skill and instinct without auteur ambition:

- Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit)
- John McTiernan (Die Hard, Predator)
- Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon)
- Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters)
- Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter)
- Sam Raimi (Spider-Man trilogy — his genre work, distinct from his auteur work)

These directors shaped what 1980s and 1990s studio cinema looked and felt like. They are not auteurs in the traditional sense — they do not have a unifying formal or philosophical project — but they are masters of a different kind. They understood their waves and executed within them at the highest level.

The Raimi case illustrates the boundary most clearly. His Spider-Man trilogy is genre craftsmanship — technically accomplished, commercially successful, working within the superhero paradigm. His Evil Dead films are something else entirely — personal, formally radical, cult-defining. One director, two traditions, two tiers.

**[YOUR INPUT: What exactly separates a genre craftsman from an auteur? The system asserts this distinction but doesn't define it. Is it about formal innovation (auteurs invent new cinematic language, craftsmen perfect existing language)? Personal obsession (auteurs can't help but make their films about the same things, craftsmen adapt to material)? Relationship to industry (auteurs work against or alongside the system, craftsmen work within it)? The answer determines where every borderline case falls — Joe Dante, Tim Burton, early Ridley Scott.]**

---

## 21. The "Tonight Test" and the Philosophy of Pleasure

The Popcorn tier's primary sorting criterion is the "tonight test": *Would I actually put this on tonight for pleasure, not obligation?*

This is elegant as a practical heuristic. But what does it mean theoretically?

**[YOUR INPUT: What IS pleasure as a curatorial criterion? The tonight test assumes that pleasure is self-evident — you either want to rewatch something or you don't. But pleasure has different registers. There's comfort (familiar films you return to like old friends), excitement (films that still thrill on the fifth viewing), nostalgia (films tied to personal history), and aesthetic pleasure (films whose craft you admire). Does the tonight test capture all of these? Or is Popcorn specifically about comfort and nostalgia — the films that define your relationship to studio cinema the way Core films define your relationship to art cinema? And is pleasure itself a valid historical category? The argument would be: what a particular generation found pleasurable tells you as much about that era as what its auteurs were doing. The 1980s teen comedy IS the 1980s, viewed from the audience's side rather than the filmmaker's.]**

---

## Open Questions

1. Should Popcorn eventually be reorganized by waves (sub-folders within decades) rather than flat browsing?
2. Should Popcorn have its own director whitelist (genre craftsmen)?
3. Should some current Reference films migrate to Popcorn if they better serve the wave-execution role?
4. How should borderline auteur/genre work be handled (Tim Burton's Batman vs. Ed Wood)?
5. Should the Popcorn cap (~255) increase if the tier takes on historical-archive responsibilities?
