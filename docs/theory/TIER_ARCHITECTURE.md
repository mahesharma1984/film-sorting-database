# Tier Architecture: Why Four Tiers, Why These Ratios

> The four tiers are not quality rankings. They are four distinct curatorial relationships a collector can have with a film.

---

## 1. Tiers as Relationships

Every film in the archive has a relationship to the collector. The four tiers name four kinds of relationship:

| Tier | Relationship | In plain language |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Core** | Identity | "This filmmaker is part of who I am" |
| **Satellite** | Interest | "This is a margin I find compelling" |
| **Popcorn** | Pleasure | "I rewatch this for fun" |
| **Reference** | Acknowledgment | "Cinema history requires I keep this" |

These are not degrees of the same thing. They are categorically different relationships. A Godard film is not "more liked" than a Spider-Man film — it is liked in a fundamentally different way. The tier system names this difference instead of collapsing it into a single scale.

---

## 2. Why Exactly Four?

**Why not three?** Collapsing Satellite and Popcorn into a single "Non-Core" tier would conflate two genuinely different relationships. Brazilian pornochanchada and Back to the Future serve completely different functions in the archive. One is texture — historical context for the 1970s exploitation boom. The other is pleasure — a film you actually put on for enjoyment. Merging them loses information.

**Why not five?** The most tempting fifth tier would be "Avant-Garde" — separating experimental cinema (Warhol, Brakhage) from narrative art cinema (Godard, Yang). But the whitelist already handles this: Warhol is a Core auteur. His formal radicalism does not separate him from the auteur thesis — it intensifies it. Adding a fifth tier would create a distinction the collection does not actually need.

**[YOUR INPUT: Did you ever consider a different tier structure? A fifth tier? Merging tiers? Was the four-tier system designed from the start, or did it emerge during the sorting process? The design history would strengthen this argument. If you initially had three tiers and found you needed to split something, that tells a story about why four is the right number.]**

## 3. The Decision Tree as Philosophical Statement

The classification system checks tiers in a specific order:

1. **Core first** — Is the director on the whitelist?
2. **Reference second** — Is the film in the reference canon?
3. **Satellite third** — Does the film match a satellite category (language, country, decade)?
4. **Popcorn fourth** — Does it pass the tonight test?
5. **Unsorted last** — If nothing matches, stage for manual review.

This priority order is not an implementation detail. It is a philosophical statement: **identity trumps everything**. A Kubrick film is Core even if it is also canonical (could be Reference), even if it is genre cinema (could be Satellite), even if it is rewatchable comfort viewing (could be Popcorn). The auteur relationship takes priority because the archive is, first and last, an auteur thesis.

Reference comes second because canonical status is more durable than genre classification or personal pleasure. Satellite comes third because historical texture matters more than individual enjoyment. Popcorn comes last — not because pleasure is least important, but because it is the most personal and least historically grounded criterion.

The decision tree is the tier architecture expressed as algorithm.

## 4. Tier Interactions

The tiers define each other through mutual exclusion:

- **Core** is not just "auteur films." It is auteur films that are not Reference canon (Citizen Kane is Reference, not Core, even though Welles is an auteur — because Welles is not on your whitelist).
- **Reference** is not just "important films." It is important films by directors not on the Core whitelist (Psycho is Reference; if Hitchcock were on the whitelist, it would be Core).
- **Satellite** is not just "exploitation." It is exploitation that is not Popcorn (Rush Hour is Popcorn despite having Hong Kong action DNA, because it is rewatchable studio entertainment).
- **Popcorn** is not just "fun." It is fun films that are not Core, Reference, or Satellite (The Big Lebowski is fun but goes to Core because the Coen Brothers are on the whitelist).

Every tier boundary is a decision about which relationship takes priority. The boundaries are not arbitrary — they follow the decision tree's priority logic. This means the tiers form a system, not a list.

---

## 5. Caps as System Constraints

Each tier has explicit or implicit caps:

| Tier | Cap | Mechanism |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Core | ~140 | Implicitly capped by the whitelist (~40 directors) |
| Reference | 50 | Hard cap — "prevents 'important' from becoming bloat" |
| Satellite | ~410 | Sum of 12 individual category caps (Giallo 30, Brazilian 45, HK Action 65, etc.) |
| Popcorn | ~255 | Sum of 10 genre caps (Comedy 50, Action 30, Superhero 25, etc.) |

Caps serve a structural purpose: they prevent any tier from overwhelming the others. Without the Reference cap, "important" films would creep to 200 and drown the personal voice. Without Satellite category caps, a casual interest in Hong Kong action could inflate to 300 films and overpower the auteur spine.

Caps enforce a principle: every tier must earn its space. When a Satellite category exceeds its cap, the weakest film gets cut — not shelved, but removed. This makes the cap not just a limit but a forcing function for curatorial quality.

## 6. The Ratio Question

The current distribution:

| Tier | Films | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Core | ~140 | 26% |
| Satellite | ~240 | 45% |
| Popcorn | ~100 | 19% |
| Reference | ~50 | 9% |

**[YOUR INPUT: Is this distribution designed or emergent?**

Three possible readings:

**If designed:** You set out to have Satellite be the largest tier. The argument would be that margins SHOULD outnumber identity — a collection with more texture than spine is more interesting than a collection that is all spine. You are drawn to more things than you are obsessed with, and the ratio reflects that honestly.

**If emergent:** The caps were set, the films were sorted, and this is what fell out. The argument would be that the system discovered an organic truth about the collection's character. You happen to have more exploitation cinema than auteur cinema, and the ratio reflects your actual collecting history.

**If both:** The caps were designed to constrain, but within those constraints, the actual ratio reveals something about you as a collector. The system was designed to be discoverable — the architecture channels, and the content reveals.

**Which is it? The answer matters for whether the ratios are prescriptive (other collections should aim for similar proportions) or descriptive (this is what one particular collection looks like).]**

## 7. Tier Density Across Decades

The tier ratios are not uniform across decades — they shift to reflect each decade's character:

| Decade | Core | Satellite | Popcorn | Reference | Character |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 1960s | Dominant | Present | Minimal | Present | Auteur decade — modernist rupture is primarily a Core phenomenon |
| 1970s | Strong | **Peak** | Moderate | Present | Dual peak — auteurs AND exploitation at maximum density |
| 1980s | Moderate | High | **Peak** | Present | Genre decade — VHS/blockbuster culture dominates |
| 1990s | High | High | High | Present | Balanced — all traditions coexist |
| 2000s+ | Selective | Moderate | Moderate | Sparse | Thinning — the present is harder to judge |

This variation is evidence that the tier system is responsive to historical reality, not imposed onto it. The 1960s really was an auteur-dominated era. The 1980s really was a genre-dominated era. The tiers capture this.

## 8. Permeable Boundaries

The tier architecture is a living system, not a fixed taxonomy. Films and directors can move:

**Promotion (Satellite → Core):** "If director becomes auteur obsession, promote to Core." When casual interest in an exploitation director deepens into genuine engagement with their full body of work, the relationship changes from "interest" to "identity," and the tier follows. (See also: [SATELLITE_DEPTH.md](SATELLITE_DEPTH.md) §5–6 — the within-category vetting pathway that precedes global Core promotion.)

**Reclassification (any tier → any tier):** Monthly review can reclassify films. A film you thought was Popcorn might reveal itself as Reference after you realize its historical significance. A Satellite film might get cut to /Out when you realize you kept it from obligation, not interest.

**Demotion (/Out):** Films that fail to justify their presence get cut. The 30-day quarantine in /Out prevents hasty deletions. But the archive is not a one-way ratchet — things leave as well as enter.

This permeability is important because it means the tier architecture describes relationships as they are now, not as they were when a film was first classified. The system tracks the collector's evolving understanding.
