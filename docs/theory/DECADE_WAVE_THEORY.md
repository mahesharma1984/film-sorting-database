# Decade-Wave Theory: Why Decades Are the Organizing Unit

> Decades are not neutral date ranges. Each decade in this archive represents a wave — a cluster of aesthetic, political, and industrial forces that give cinema from that period a coherent character.

## 1. The Claim

This archive is organized by decade not because decades are convenient (though they are) but because they correspond to real shifts in how cinema was made, distributed, and understood. The 1960s are not "films from 1960-1969." The 1960s are the moment when modernist rupture broke classical cinema open — when Godard, Antonioni, Pasolini, and their contemporaries across multiple countries simultaneously reimagined what a film could be.

Each decade carries a wave label:

| Decade | Wave | Character |
|--------|------|-----------|
| 1950s | Classical Late Period | Studio system decline, genre peaks (musicals, westerns, epics) |
| 1960s | Modernist Rupture | New Waves across France, Italy, Japan, Brazil. The break with classical narrative |
| 1970s | Political Cinema + Exploitation Boom | New Hollywood, political auteurs, exploitation margins at their densest |
| 1980s | Postmodern Genre Turn | Independent/cult auteurs, VHS ecology, high-concept blockbusters |
| 1990s | Global Arthouse Consolidation | The art film goes global (Taiwan, HK, Iran). American indie converges with mainstream |
| 2000s-2010s | Late Digital / Festival Cinema | Late-career auteurs, festival circuit as primary distribution, streaming emergence |

These labels are not taxonomic — they do not capture every film from a decade. They capture the dominant force, the thing that makes that decade's cinema recognizably different from the decade before and after.

**[YOUR INPUT: Are these wave labels settled? The 1950s label feels thin — "Classical Late Period" barely scratches the surface. And "Late Digital / Festival Cinema" for 2000s-2010s feels like a placeholder. What do these decades ACTUALLY mean to you as a collector? The 1960s and 1970s labels are confident and specific. The others may need the same level of conviction.]**

## 2. Why Not Movements?

The obvious alternative to decades is movements: French New Wave, Cinema Novo, New Hollywood, Dogme 95. Movements are more precise — they name specific aesthetic programs with identified participants and manifestos.

But movements are too narrow. They cover 5-10 years of one national cinema. The 1970s, organized by movements, fragments into half a dozen separate stories: New Hollywood here, German New Cinema there, Brazilian Cinema Marginal somewhere else. What gets lost is the fact that these movements were simultaneous and responsive to each other. Coppola and Fassbinder and Sganzerla were all working in the 1970s, all responding to similar political pressures, all making films about power and its corruption. A movement-based organization hides this transnational dialogue.

The decade holds multiple movements together and reveals their interactions. The 1960s contains French New Wave AND Italian modernism AND Japanese New Wave AND the beginnings of exploitation cinema. These are not separate stories — they are facets of the same historical moment. The decade is wide enough to show the field.

## 3. Why Not National Cinemas?

Another alternative: organize by country. French cinema in one wing, Japanese in another, American in a third.

This archive already contains French, Italian, Japanese, Brazilian, American, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong cinema. Organizing by nation would scatter the 1970s wave across seven folders. It would separate Godard from Fassbinder, Pasolini from Suzuki — filmmakers who were responding to each other across borders, exhibiting at the same festivals, citing each other's work.

The Core whitelist proves why national cinema is the wrong primary axis. The 1960s Core directors include Godard (France), Pasolini (Italy), Antonioni (Italy), Suzuki (Japan), Kubrick (US/UK), Fellini (Italy), Varda (France), Resnais (France). These directors are not interesting because of their nationalities. They are interesting because they all participated in the same rupture, from different positions. The decade holds them together; nationality would scatter them.

Nation still matters — it governs Satellite routing (Portuguese-language films map to Brazilian Exploitation, Italian films to Giallo). But nation is a secondary axis, not the primary one.

## 4. Why Not Auteur Clusters?

Many personal film archives organize by director: the Godard shelf, the Kubrick shelf, the Lynch shelf. This has obvious appeal — it groups a filmmaker's evolution in one place.

This archive uses directors as a subdivision within decades, not as the primary axis. The reason is that a director's work changes meaning depending on its historical context. 1960s Godard (Breathless, Vivre Sa Vie, Weekend) is the filmmaker who broke cinema open. 1980s Godard (Every Man for Himself, Passion, Hail Mary) is the filmmaker processing the aftermath of that rupture from two decades of distance. These are not the same artistic project. They belong to different waves.

The whitelist structure proves this. Godard appears under five decades: 1960s (peak), 1970s (political), 1980s (late), 1990s-2000s (final). His career spans multiple waves, and the archive treats each phase as belonging to its wave, not to a monolithic "Godard" category. The same applies to Kubrick (1960s-1990s), Lynch (1980s-2000s), Scorsese (1970s-1980s), and others.

A director's career is a thread that passes through multiple waves. The decade-wave structure preserves both the thread (you can follow Godard across decades) and the wave (you can see Godard alongside his 1960s contemporaries).

## 5. Decades Are Not Arbitrary — The Code Proves It

The strongest evidence that decades correspond to real historical periods, not convenience, comes from the classification system itself. The satellite categories are historically bounded:

- **Brazilian Exploitation:** 1970s-1980s only (the pornochanchada boom)
- **Giallo:** 1960s-1980s only (Italian genre cinema's golden age)
- **Pinku Eiga:** 1960s-1980s only (Japanese pink film era)
- **Hong Kong Action:** 1970s-1990s only (pre-handover boom)
- **Blaxploitation:** 1970s only (the civil rights-era genre)

These date ranges are not arbitrary cutoffs. They correspond to actual industrial and cultural shifts — the end of the Brazilian pornochanchada cycle, the decline of Italian genre filmmaking, the 1997 Hong Kong handover. If decades were mere convenience, these ranges would not align so cleanly with historical events.

The decade density data tells the same story:
- **1970s is the largest wave** (~225 films) because it genuinely was the most productive era for both auteur and exploitation cinema
- **1960s is Core-dominant** because the modernist rupture was primarily an auteur phenomenon
- **1980s is Satellite+Popcorn co-dominant** because the VHS/blockbuster era produced more genre and commercial cinema than auteur cinema
- **1990s is balanced** because global arthouse, HK action, and studio entertainment all peaked simultaneously

The collection's shape mirrors cinema history's shape. This is not imposed — it is discovered.

## 6. What a Wave Is

A wave is not just "films made during this time." It is a cluster of forces that produce a recognizable kind of cinema:

**Aesthetic forces:** What do films from this period look like? The 1960s brought jump cuts, long takes, direct address. The 1980s brought music-video editing, neon palettes, high-concept visual shorthand.

**Political forces:** What pressures are filmmakers responding to? The 1970s responded to Vietnam, Watergate, and global political upheaval. The 1990s responded to the end of the Cold War and the rise of globalization.

**Industrial forces:** How are films produced and distributed? The 1960s saw the collapse of the old studio system. The 1980s saw the VHS revolution. The 2010s saw streaming's dominance.

**Generational forces:** Who is making the films? The 1960s were the first film-school generation. The 1990s were the first generation raised on home video, fluent in film history.

A wave is the intersection of all four forces. When they align — when aesthetic ambition, political urgency, industrial disruption, and a new generation of filmmakers converge — you get a decade with a strong identity. The 1960s and 1970s have the strongest wave identities in this archive because all four forces were at peak intensity.

**[YOUR INPUT: Is this framework (aesthetic + political + industrial + generational) how you think about what makes a decade cohere? Or is there a simpler formulation — something more intuitive about what "wave" means to you as a collector?]**

## 7. Boundary Cases

Decades are approximations. Some films straddle boundaries:

- **Eraserhead (1977)** feels like 1980s cinema — Lynch's sensibility is postmodern, not political. The archive places it in the 1970s (by release date) but notes it "bridges to 1980s."
- **In the Mood for Love (2000)** is the culmination of 1990s Wong Kar-wai, released one year into the 2000s. It bridges two decades.
- **The Conformist (1970)** is Bertolucci's masterpiece, but its sensibility is 1960s modernist. It bridges from 1960s to 1970s.

The system handles this with the "bridges to" notation and multi-decade director placement. A film is placed by release year, but its wave affiliation can be acknowledged through cross-referencing. This is honest about the approximation while maintaining organizational clarity.

**[YOUR INPUT: How do you handle a film from 1979 that feels like 1980s cinema? Or a 1990 film that's really the last gasp of 1980s culture? Do you go strictly by release year, or would you ever override? The "bridges to" convention is a good solution, but is it enough?]**

## 8. The Waves in Summary

**1950s — Classical Late Period.** The studio system producing its final masterworks. Genre peaks (musicals, westerns, epics) before the old model collapses. Satyajit Ray begins in India. Bresson and Wilder work at the height of classical form.

**1960s — Modernist Rupture.** The most generative wave. New Waves erupt simultaneously in France, Italy, Japan, Brazil. Classical narrative breaks open. Jump cuts, direct address, self-reflexivity, political engagement. The highest Core director density in the archive.

**1970s — Political Cinema + Exploitation Boom.** New Hollywood converges with European political cinema. Fassbinder, Coppola, Cassavetes, Scorsese, Tarkovsky. Simultaneously, exploitation cinema explodes: Brazilian pornochanchada, giallo at its peak, American grindhouse, blaxploitation. The largest wave in the archive (~225 films) because both auteur and exploitation traditions peak here.

**1980s — Postmodern Genre Turn.** The auteur moves to the margins: Lynch, Yang, Jarmusch, Coen Brothers work outside the studio system. Meanwhile, the blockbuster boom and VHS revolution transform commercial cinema. Satellite and Popcorn co-dominate because genre cinema (exploitation + studio entertainment) is this decade's primary mode.

**1990s — Global Arthouse Consolidation.** The art film goes truly global: Taiwan (Yang, Hou), Hong Kong (Wong Kar-wai), Iran (Kiarostami), Poland (Kieslowski) join the traditional European centers. American indie cinema converges with the mainstream (Coen Brothers, Hartley, P.T. Anderson). The most balanced decade across tiers.

**2000s-2010s — Late Digital / Festival Cinema.** Late-career auteurs (Malick, Lynch, Godard) produce final masterworks. The festival circuit becomes the primary distribution system for art cinema. Digital technology transforms both production and distribution. Selective and thin compared to earlier decades — partly because the present is harder to judge, partly because streaming has not yet produced its own wave identity.
