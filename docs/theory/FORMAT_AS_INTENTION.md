# Format as Intention: The Theory of Format Curation

> Seeking out a 35mm scan when a standard 1080p exists is a curatorial act — a statement about how seriously you take a specific film's viewing experience.

## 1. The Origin Story

This theory emerged from a bug.

In v0.1 of the classification system, format signals (35mm, 4K, Open Matte, Criterion, Director's Cut) were being treated as tier classification. Films with format signals were routing to Popcorn, on the logic that format curation indicates personal investment, and personal investment means pleasure viewing.

The bug was subtle because the logic was half-right. Format curation DOES indicate personal investment. But the conclusion was wrong. A 35mm scan of Breathless is not Popcorn — it is Core. A 35mm scan of Die Hard is not Core — it is Reference (or Popcorn). The format tells you about the edition. The tier tells you about the relationship. These are orthogonal.

The fix was simple: treat format signals as metadata, not classification. But the insight was deeper: format curation is a curatorial act that operates ACROSS tiers, not within them.

## 2. Format as Investment Signal

When the archive contains a 35mm open matte scan of Spider-Man (2002) alongside a standard WEB-DL of some other film, the format difference signals something: the collector went out of their way to find the best possible version of Spider-Man. This is not a technical preference. It is a statement of care.

The format signals that indicate investment:

- **35mm scans** — Preserving the original theatrical presentation
- **Open matte** — Preserving full-frame compositions as originally shot
- **Extended / Director's cuts** — Preserving the filmmaker's intention against studio compromise
- **Criterion editions** — Preserving films with scholarly apparatus (essays, commentary, restoration)
- **4K / UHD remux** — Preserving maximum visual fidelity
- **Commentary tracks** — Preserving production history and critical context

Each of these represents a choice. The collector could have kept the standard version. Instead, they sought out something better. That act of seeking is itself curatorial.

The inverse is also telling. A standard WEB-DL with no special features might mean: "I have this film, but I haven't invested in it." This is not a judgment — some films don't need investment. But the absence of format curation is information, just as its presence is.

## 3. Preserving the Theatrical Experience

In an era of streaming, where films are delivered algorithmically in standardized formats, deliberately curating physical-era presentations is an act of historical preservation.

**35mm scans** preserve what cinema looked like in theaters — the grain, the color timing, the projection characteristics that are lost in digital transfers. A 35mm scan of Batman (1989) is not just "better quality." It is a record of what audiences saw in 1989.

**Open matte** preserves full-frame compositions that streaming services routinely crop to widescreen. The open matte version of Spider-Man shows compositions as the cinematographer framed them, not as an algorithm decided to reframe them.

**Extended cuts** preserve creative decisions that studios overruled for commercial reasons. Spider-Man 2.1 and Spider-Man 3.1 contain Raimi's preferred versions — closer to the filmmaker's vision than the theatrical release.

**[YOUR INPUT: Is there an anti-streaming thesis embedded here? The language in the existing docs — "anti-streaming crop," "preserving theatrical experience" — suggests something more than neutral preservation. Is format curation partly about RESISTANCE to the way streaming platforms treat cinema? If so, name it. The argument would be: streaming turns films into content (standardized, disposable, interchangeable). Format curation turns films back into artifacts (specific, invested, irreplaceable). Is that your position?]**

## 4. Format Across Tiers

The same act of format curation means different things in different tiers:

**Core:** Criterion edition of a Godard film = academic preservation. The format apparatus (essays, restored footage, commentary) serves the auteur thesis. You are preserving this filmmaker's work with scholarly care because their work is part of your intellectual identity.

**Reference:** 35mm scan of Psycho = canonical preservation. The format serves historical fidelity. You are preserving a landmark film in its original presentation because cinema history demands accuracy.

**Satellite:** 35mm scan of a giallo film = exploitation preservation. The format serves texture — the grain and color of a 1970s Italian genre film ARE part of its character. A clean digital transfer would sanitize the very thing that makes it Satellite.

**Popcorn:** 35mm open matte Spider-Man = pleasure-based preservation. The format serves the viewing experience. You are preserving your favorite way to watch a film you love.

The act is identical across tiers: seek out the best version. The motivation differs. This is why format cannot determine tier — it operates on a different axis entirely.

## 5. Format and Wave Theory

**[YOUR INPUT: Does the meaning of format curation change by decade?**

**Consider:**

- **1960s 35mm:** In the 1960s, 35mm was the standard theatrical format. Preserving a 35mm scan of a 1960s film is preserving the DEFAULT — what everyone saw. The curation is about fidelity to the original experience.

- **1980s 35mm vs. VHS:** In the 1980s, the gap between theatrical and home video was vast. Many films were experienced primarily on VHS. A 35mm scan of an 1980s film preserves the THEATRICAL version against the VHS version that most people actually saw. The curation is about recovering the superior original.

- **2000s 35mm:** By the 2000s, many films were shot and projected digitally. A 35mm scan of a 2000s film (if one exists) preserves a format that was already becoming anachronistic. The curation is about preserving a DYING format.

- **2010s 4K:** In the 2010s, 4K represents the cutting edge. A 4K version preserves maximum fidelity from the digital era. The curation is about technological ambition.

**Does this trajectory — from default to recovery to preservation to ambition — resonate? If format significance is wave-specific, then the theory of format curation is deeper than "better quality." It is about the CHANGING RELATIONSHIP between cinema and its material substrate across decades.]**

## 6. What Format Is Not

Format is not quality judgment. A 720p YIFY encode of a Godard film is still Core. A pristine 4K remux of a generic action film is still Unsorted if it does not fit any tier. The format of a file tells you about the collector's investment in that specific copy. It tells you nothing about the film's place in cinema history.

This is the lesson of the v0.1 bug: confusing format (metadata about the edition) with tier (the film's curatorial role) produces wrong classifications. The system now treats them as separate dimensions:

- **Tier** answers: What is this film's relationship to the archive's thesis?
- **Format** answers: How much did the collector invest in this particular copy?

Both are meaningful. Neither determines the other.
