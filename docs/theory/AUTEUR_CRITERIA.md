# Auteur Criteria: What Makes a Director Core

> The Core whitelist is not a list of the best directors. It is a statement of curatorial identity — "these are the filmmakers whose work defines my understanding of cinema history."

---

## 1. The Whitelist as Thesis

The Core director whitelist (~38-43 directors) is the single most consequential curatorial decision in the archive. It determines which films automatically receive the highest tier, which filmmakers constitute the collection's identity, and — read as a whole — what story the archive tells about cinema.

The whitelist is not a canon. Canons claim objectivity ("these are the great directors"). The whitelist claims identity ("these are MY directors"). This distinction matters because it shifts the burden of proof. A canon must justify every inclusion against universal criteria. A whitelist must justify every inclusion against the collector's thesis about cinema history.

The thesis, expressed through the whitelist: cinema history from the 1950s to the 2010s is a story of auteurs who broke open classical form (1960s), politicized it (1970s), pushed it to the margins (1980s), and globalized it (1990s). The whitelist is the cast of characters in that story.

## 2. The Narrative Arc

Read chronologically, the whitelist traces a narrative:

**1960s: Modernist Rupture.** Godard, Rivette, Melville, Pasolini, Antonioni, Resnais, Varda, Suzuki, Demy, Fellini, Kubrick, Bertolucci. The largest director cohort in the archive. These filmmakers broke cinema open simultaneously across France, Italy, Japan, and the US/UK. The density is highest here because the modernist rupture was the most generative wave — the moment when everything changed.

**1970s: Political Cinema + Auteur Expansion.** Godard (political phase), Rivette, Ray, Cassavetes, Fassbinder, Akerman, Tarkovsky, Oshima, Duras, Malick, Scorsese, Bertolucci, Herzog, Fellini, Coppola, Kubrick, De Palma, Lumet, Morrissey. The political pressures of the era (Vietnam, Watergate, global upheaval) produce filmmakers who use cinema as a tool for interrogating power. New Hollywood converges with European political cinema.

**1980s: Postmodern Genre Turn.** Godard (late phase), Yang, Scorsese, Lynch, Coen Brothers, Jarmusch, Ruiz, Kubrick, Almodóvar, De Palma. The cohort shrinks. The auteur moves to the margins — Lynch works outside the studio system, Yang works in Taiwanese independence cinema, Jarmusch invents American indie minimalism. The studio system belongs to blockbusters now; the auteur occupies the edges.

**1990s: Global Arthouse Consolidation.** Godard, Yang, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Hartley, Coen Brothers, Jarmusch, Lynch, Rohmer, Denis, Malick, Kubrick, Kieślowski, P.T. Anderson, Almodóvar. The art film goes global. Taiwan (Yang, Hou), Hong Kong (Wong Kar-wai), Poland (Kieślowski) join the traditional European centers. American indie matures (Hartley, P.T. Anderson). The cohort is large again — not because of a single rupture but because multiple traditions converge.

**2000s-2010s: Late Digital / Festival Cinema.** Wong Kar-wai, Yang, Hou, Lynch, Malick, P.T. Anderson, Refn. The cohort thins to late-career auteurs producing final masterworks and a few newer voices. This may reflect the difficulty of judging the present, or it may reflect a genuine thinning of the auteur tradition in the digital era.

The narrative is not just a list. It is a STORY — about how cinema's artistic ambition moved from the center (1960s studio-adjacent modernism) to the margins (1980s independence) to global reach (1990s consolidation) to an uncertain present.

## 3. The Operational Rule

Once a director is on the whitelist, classification is mechanical:

> Any film by a whitelisted director in their relevant decade = automatic Core tier.

This is a deliberate separation of reasoning from precision. The REASONING happened once, when the director was evaluated for whitelist inclusion. It required cultural judgment, historical knowledge, and personal engagement. After that, every individual film classification is PRECISION — a binary lookup. Is the director on the list? Yes or no.

This design has a practical benefit: it eliminates case-by-case judgment for the ~140 Core films. You never have to decide whether THIS Godard film is "Core-worthy." Godard is Core. All his films are Core. The decision was made at the director level, not the film level.

---

## 4. Formal Criteria for Core Status

**[YOUR INPUT: This is the single most important gap in the theoretical framework. The whitelist exists, but the criteria for inclusion are nowhere stated explicitly. From analyzing the whitelist, I can infer several possible criteria — but these are inferences, not your stated principles. Please confirm, revise, or replace them.**

**Inferred Criterion 1: Sustained body of work.** Every Core director has multiple films in the collection. There are no one-hit-wonders on the whitelist. This suggests that Core status requires demonstrated commitment to filmmaking over time, not a single breakthrough.

**Inferred Criterion 2: Formal distinctiveness.** Every Core director has a recognizable visual, structural, or philosophical language. You can identify a Godard film, a Lynch film, a Wong Kar-wai film from a single frame. This suggests that Core status requires a personal cinematic language, not just "good films."

**Inferred Criterion 3: Relationship to a wave.** Every Core director either defines, extends, or disrupts the wave they belong to. Godard defines the 1960s rupture. Fassbinder extends political cinema into personal melodrama. Lynch disrupts the 1980s genre turn by making it strange. This suggests that Core status requires historical significance within a wave, not just individual achievement.

**Inferred Criterion 4: Personal investment.** The collector has engaged deeply with this filmmaker — watched multiple films, sought out obscure works, formed opinions about the career arc. This suggests that Core is partly autobiographical: these are directors you have a relationship with, not just directors you acknowledge.

**Are these the right criteria? Are there others? And how do they interact — does a director need ALL four, or is any one sufficient?]**

## 5. Boundary Cases

The boundary between Core and Satellite reveals the criteria by negative example:

**Warhol = Core. Russ Meyer = Satellite.** Both are prolific, recognizable, and historically significant. Both work in exploitation-adjacent territory. The implied distinction: Warhol's work connects to avant-garde/art-world discourse (fits the modernist thesis). Meyer's work is genre exploitation (texture, not identity).

**[YOUR INPUT: Is this the real reason? Or is it simpler — you are obsessed with Warhol's work (identity relationship) but interested in Meyer's work (texture relationship)? If the latter, the criterion is fundamentally about your relationship to the filmmaker, not about the filmmaker's objective status.]**

**Jodorowsky = Core. Tsui Hark = Satellite.** Both are auteurs with recognizable styles. The system classifies Jodorowsky as "auteur-driven cult" (Core) and Tsui Hark as "genre master" (Satellite). But both make highly personal genre-bending films.

**[YOUR INPUT: What separates "auteur-driven cult" from "genre master"? Is it that Jodorowsky's films are about Jodorowsky (personal vision imposed on genre material) while Tsui Hark's films are about the genre (elevating genre material through craft)? Or is it something else?]**

**Sam Raimi: Split across tiers.** Darkman and Evil Dead = auteur work (Core-adjacent or Satellite). Spider-Man = genre craftsmanship (Popcorn). One director, two (or three) tiers.

**[YOUR INPUT: How do you handle directors who straddle? The whitelist is per-director, but some directors have genuinely split careers. Is the whitelist too blunt an instrument for these cases?]**

## 6. Multi-Decade Presence

Some directors span multiple decades on the whitelist:

- **Jean-Luc Godard:** 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (five decades)
- **Stanley Kubrick:** 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s (four decades)
- **David Lynch:** 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (three decades)
- **Satyajit Ray:** 1950s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s (four decades)
- **Edward Yang:** 1980s, 1990s, 2000s (three decades)

Multi-decade presence is meaningful. It means the director's work tracks across multiple waves, serving as a connective thread through the archive. Godard across five decades is not just "a long career" — it is a thesis about how one filmmaker's evolution mirrors cinema's evolution. His 1960s work breaks modernism open; his 1970s work politicizes it; his 1980s-2000s work processes the aftermath. Following Godard through the archive IS following cinema history.

This is why the archive organizes by decade first, director second. The decade holds the wave context. The director provides the thread. Together they produce richer meaning than either alone.

## 7. The Whitelist Is Not Closed

The whitelist anticipates future growth. Directors currently marked for potential addition include:

- Abbas Kiarostami (1990s-2000s) — PRIORITY
- Tsai Ming-liang (1990s-2010s) — PRIORITY
- Apichatpong Weerasethakul (2000s-2010s) — PRIORITY
- Hong Sang-soo (2000s-2010s)
- Pedro Costa (2000s-2010s)
- Takeshi Kitano (1990s-2000s)
- Shohei Imamura (1960s-1970s)
- Kelly Reichardt (2000s-2010s)
- Jia Zhangke (2000s-2010s)
- Lucrecia Martel (2000s-2010s)

These additions are contingent on acquiring films, not on any theoretical barrier. The whitelist grows as the collection grows. A director becomes a candidate when the collector begins engaging with their work seriously enough that the relationship shifts from "acknowledged" to "essential."

The promotion path from Satellite also feeds the whitelist. A director who starts as Satellite texture (e.g., Wakamatsu, Candeias, Ferrara) can be promoted to Core when the collector's engagement deepens to the point of auteur obsession. The whitelist is a living document.
