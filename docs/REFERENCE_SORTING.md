## REFERENCE ADJUSTMENT NEEDED

### Films to MOVE TO POPCORN (Format Curation Signal)

**Back to the Future trilogy** - Has 35mm open matte = Popcorn investment
- Move from Reference → Popcorn

**Silence of the Lambs** - Has 35mm Full Frame = could be Popcorn
- Decision needed: Reference (canonical) vs. Popcorn (format signal)

**The Matrix 35mm** - Canonical + format
- Keep in Reference (too defining of 1990s)

**Spider-Man 35mm Full Frame** - Already categorized as Popcorn ✓

---
